Schuyler VanValkenburg as ""too extreme"" for the 72nd House District in wetern Henrico County.
Vandergriff recently sent voters a mailer with a colored picture of a mother nuzzling a newborn, and a black and white shot of VanValkenburg in the background. ""Did her life have value 10 minutes before she was born?"" the capitalized print asks. ""Socialist Democrat Schuyler VanValkenburg says no.""
The flip side says ""Schuyler VanValkenburg was the co-sponsor of the Democratic bill that would have allowed abortion until the moment of birth."" We fact checked this statement.
Vandergriff’s mailer erroneously cites as its source a bill that made no mention of abortion. It would have required health insurers to cover pasteurized, donated human breast milk, which in rare instance is needed for infants. The measure never came up for a vote and died. 
Matt Williams, spokesman for Vandergriff’s campaign, said the correct source is an unsuccessful bill that would have eased the state abortion restrictions. It was introduced in January 2019 by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax. VanValkenburg was among 21 Democratic co-sponsors.
Debate focused on the bill’s provisions for rare third-trimester abortions, which are allowed if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" harm her mental or physical health.
The legislation would have lowered the threshold of certifying physicians to one. That doctor would have to attest that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" test would have been repealed.
Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 28 hearing, acknowledged her legislation would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating. Many Republicans claim the bill shows Democrats support ""abortion to the time of birth."" The bill died on a partisan 5-3 vote in a House subcommittee VanValkenburg doesn’t sit on.
Third trimester abortions are extremely rare; the state Department of Health has recorded two this century. But even with failure of Tran’s bill, they are legal in Virginia. The Supreme Court ruled in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision that states may prohibit an abortion after fetal viability if there are exceptions to protect the life or mental or physical health of the mother. 
This undercuts Vandergriff’s claim that the bill would have ""allowed abortion until the moment of birth."" That possibility already existed. Virginia law allows third-trimester abortions if three doctors certify that ""the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the dealth of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman."" Tran’s bill would have eased those requirements.
Vandergriff is not the only candidate misstating the bill. During the course of writing this fact-check, Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, began making similar charges against her opponent, Del. Debra Rodman. Rodman also co-sponsored Tran’s bill and next to Tran while she was testified in the January hearing.
Dunnavant has sent a mailer saying Rodman ""proposed legalizing abortion in the ninth month."" Dunnavant is also running a TV ad saying, ""Debra Rodman’s bill would allow late-term abortions for any reason up to the moment of birth.""
Our ruling 
Vandergriff says VanValkenburg co-sponsored a bill that would have ""allowed abortion until the moment of birth."" 
She’s referring to a bill, introduced in January 2019. Vandergriff’s claim is misleading because third-trimester abortions were already protected by federal law and allowed in Virginia in extremely rare conditions when three doctors certify that pregnancy will ""likely"" kill the mother, or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health.
The bill - which VanValkenburg did co-sponsor, would not have created an unconditioned right to a third-trimester abortion, as Vandergriff suggests. It would have loosened the requirements for getting one by allowing one doctor to certify the abortion is necessary to protect the mother’s life or health.
We rate Vandergriff’s statement False."
0,"""Over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America’s major cities has dropped, unlike here (Chicago), by more than 10%.""","on Tuesday, October 29th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/oct/29/donald-trump/trump-dead-wrong-about-change-murders-chicago/,Pants on Fire!,Donald Trump,Trump ‘dead wrong’ about the change in murders in Chicago | PolitiFact Illinois,"During his first visit to Chicago since taking office, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his favorite targets: the city’s violence.
While criticizing Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson for boycotting his speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Monday, Trump again repeated a Pants on Fire! claim about the city having the nation’s strictest gun laws, compared violence in Chicago to Afghanistan — as he has in the past with Baltimore — and contended reductions in crime here are failing to keep pace with those being made nationally.
""Over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America’s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%,"" Trump said. ""And if we ever took the Chicago numbers out of our total numbers, the numbers would be incredible — and they already are, even including Chicago.""
Nationally, murders have not decreased by quite as much as the president said. What’s more, his Chicago comparison is contradicted by city and federal data. Not only has Chicago seen murders fall by significantly more than 10% in recent years, its decline is rivaled by few other large cities.
Press officers at the White House did not respond to our request for comment.
Chicago taking a lead, not falling behind
Chicago has seen 27% fewer murders so far this year than it had at this time two years ago, Chicago Police Department data for mid-October show.
Preliminary federal data for 2019 is not yet available, however, so we compared the latest federal data — from 2018 — with figures for 2016. That’s the year Johnson became the city’s top cop. It’s also a year that saw a significant spike in Chicago murders, ending with 765 in all, a total greater than the tallies for New York City and Los Angeles combined.
Those figures, which are reported by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, show Trump missed the mark on multiple counts.
First, the number of murders reported nationwide for 2018 was 6.9% lower than it was in 2016 — not more than 10%, as he claimed.
Second, the declines experienced by Chicago during the same period — from 765 murders to 563 — were larger than those seen in all but three of the nation’s 30 largest cities: San Antonio, San Diego and San Jose.
It’s a turnaround that’s garnered considerable news coverage over the past two years. In 2018, for instance, the Chicago Sun-Times reviewed FBI data for the previous year and found Chicago alone accounted for 86% of the net decrease from 2016 in murders nationally.
That marked decline is also something Johnson turned to in defense when responding to Trump’s attack.
""The president is right about one thing: Violent crime in the United States declined last year for the second consecutive year,"" Johnson said at a news conference Monday. ""But it was Chicago that set the table for those reductions.""
Ames Grawert, who leads the quantitative research team at the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, said that although Chicago’s per capita murder rate is still more than four times higher than the national average, the city has made considerable progress in recent years — something Trump’s comments ignore.
""He’s dead wrong on Chicago,"" Grawert said. ""The city’s gotten a lot safer in the past two years and it’s not right to say Chicago’s lagging the national trend … It’s one of the cities that’s led the downward trend of the last two years.""
Our ruling
Referring to Chicago, Trump said that ""over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America’s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%.""
Chicago has seen a nearly 30% decrease in murders over the past several years. That well outpaces the national decline of just under 7%. Rather than holding the nation back, as Trump suggested, Chicago’s progress has contributed to the national decline in violent crime.
We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!

In one post published Oct. 22, an account called Holistic Health & More, which has more than 165,000 followers, claimed the flu shot can lead to the death of fetuses.
""4250% increase fetal death from flu shot,"" the photo reads. ""CDC failed to tell pregnant mothers of the increase (sic) chance of miscarriage & stillbirth after receiving CDC recommended flu vaccine.""  
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram’s parent company.) It has more than 1,700 likes, and PolitiFact found several copies of the post elsewhere on the internet.

(Screenshot from Instagram)
As evidence for its claim, Holistic Health & More linked to a website called VacTruth.com, a known publisher of anti-vaccine misinformation. The site requires a password to enter, so we were not able to locate the article in question. Holistic Health & More did not respond to a message requesting more evidence.
We found one study that did observe a spike in ""spontaneous abortion,"" or miscarriage, among women who had been vaccinated for the flu — but the bulk of research has found no link between the vaccine and infant mortality. Importantly, medical officials still recommend pregnant women get the flu shot because they can be more prone to severe illness from the flu, as can their babies.
Where the post came from
We traced the Instagram post to an anti-vaccine blog entry from November 2016. The blog, Health Freedom Idaho, is part of a libertarian movement that opposes health regulations and advocates for nontraditional care. 
The blog post links to a 2013 study published by the journal Human & Experimental Toxicology. It looked at miscarriages and stillbirths listed in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database of reported vaccine side effects maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.
RELATED: No, you’re not an ‘active, live walking virus’ for 2 weeks following a flu shot
The study found an increase in ""fetal loss reports"" among pregnant women who received the flu shot during two consecutive seasons, from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010. (The season typically spans from fall to spring.) Approximately 587,600 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot in 2008-09, and about 2,236,000 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot and/or the swine flu vaccine the next year.
The study noted a jump in fetal loss reports from four in 2008-09 to 174 in 2009-10. 
That’s a 4,250% increase — but it doesn’t mean you should interpret it the way this blogger did.
The researchers did not prove that the flu shot was the cause of the uptick.
The CDC lists several limitations of this data. The reason why it’s unreliable has to do with the fact that health care providers are encouraged to report any health problems following the administration of vaccines — even if they don’t believe the vaccine was the cause.
""Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,"" the CDC’s list of limitations reads. ""The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.""
Experts concurred with those limitations.
""The study you cite is trying to do something with VAERS data which is not valid,"" said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health, in an email. ""The results of this study do not contribute to our scientific understanding of the issue.""
Other research shows no link
The study cited by the Instagram post isn’t the only one to link the flu shot with miscarriages. But most research shows that the vaccine is safe, and the CDC recommends it for all pregnant women so they can avoid complications caused by flu infections.
One study, which was published in the journal Vaccine in September 2017, compared nearly 500 pregnant women who had miscarriages during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 flu seasons to the same number of women who had normal deliveries during the same period. Researchers found that, of the women who miscarried, 17 had received the flu shot within a month of miscarrying and also received the vaccine the year prior.
However, the study’s authors warned that the results did not suggest a causal link between the flu vaccine and miscarriage — and they still said pregnant women should receive the flu shot. On its website, the CDC also doubts the study’s results.
RELATED: Bloggers poison truth in claim about flu shot dangers
The CDC says the bulk of research supports the notion that the flu shot is safe for pregnant women and that the risk of miscarriage is low. It cites several studies that have found no increased risk of miscarriage as a result of receiving the flu shot.
• A 2013 study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology did not find an increased risk of pregnancy loss within four weeks of receiving the flu vaccine.
• A 2014 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that, among 57,554 vaccinated and unvaccinated women, the flu vaccine did not lead to an increased or decreased risk of ""preterm birth.""
• A 2017 review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between 2010 and 2016 found no evidence to suggest a connection between the flu vaccine and pregnancy complications.
• A 2017 study found that, even when it is administered during the first trimester of pregnancy, the flu vaccine was not associated with structural birth defects.
In addition to the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that pregnant women receive the flu shot.
""In evaluating all of the available scientific information, there is insufficient information to support changing the current recommendation which is to offer and encourage routine flu vaccinations during pregnancy regardless of the trimester of pregnancy,"" Haywood Brown, former president of the professional association, wrote in September 2017.
Our ruling
An Instagram post claimed that there is a 4,250% increase in fetal death from flu shots.
That claim can be traced to a 2013 study that found an increase in fetal death among pregnant women between two consecutive flu seasons. But the CDC and experts say the way that data was collected was problematic. The bulk of research shows there is no connection between miscarriage and the flu shot, and the CDC and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend all pregnant women get the vaccine.
The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False."

Andrew Cuomo’s high-profile economic development initiatives, the Buffalo Billion, has come under criticism from political rivals and investigation by federal authorities. Cuomo has declared the years-long effort a success and claimed it has boosted the local economy. 
When Cuomo announced another pricey economic development endeavor, this time for a silicon carbide fabrication facility near Utica, Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb tweeted his incredulousness. 
""With the Buffalo Billion disaster still breaking every job promise, we get another new ‘economic development project’ from the governor – half a BILLION taxpayer dollars given away touted as job creation. 614 jobs promised … that’s $814,000/job?!"" the Republican from Canandaigua wrote.

Has the Buffalo Billion broken every job promise, as Kolb claims? 
We looked at projects that were announced with some job promise attached. Not all Buffalo Billion projects had a promise of a specific amount of jobs. We reached out to Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, for details on these projects and looked at other sources for information.  
The SolarCity project 
Perhaps the most recognizable project is the Tesla solar panel factory at the waterfront site known as RiverBend in South Buffalo, into which the state has invested $750 million. An agreement between the state and SolarCity in 2014 called for the creation of more than 1,450 direct manufacturing jobs at the new facility and more than 2,000 other jobs throughout the state to provide solar services within five years, as well as the creation of 1,440 indirect jobs to support the factory. The expectation was that the solar panel factory would create 5,000 jobs, and under Tesla ownership, that is still the goal. But parts of the agrement have changed. A series of amendments have revised job creation requirements. For example, a requirement to bring in 1,440 jobs through local suppliers was taken out of the agreement. The current agreement calls for 1,460 jobs by April 2020, including 500 manufacturing jobs at the factory, and 5,000 jobs in the state by 2028. Some of those jobs have been created by Panasonic, also located at RiverBend.   
According to Empire State Development, there are 730 full-time employees and 43 contingent contractors working at RiverBend, which satisfies the current agreement at this time. If the company does not make its hiring requirements next year, Cuomo said he will fine the company $41.2 million. Job creation goal: Amended and met so far.  
The other projects
• IBM Buffalo Innovation Center: This project was the beneficiary of a $55 million state investment. In 2014 the state announced that the IBM project would create 500 jobs and set a deadline for those jobs at Jan. 1, 2020. The state now reports that ""over 181 IT jobs have been created"" and that the center is working with the state to reach its goal of creating 500 jobs by 2021. Job creation goal: Incomplete, deadline moved.   
• Albany Molecular Research Inc.: This pharma research and development project was originally announced in December 2012, with a promise of 250 jobs and a state investment of $50 million. Two years later, he goal was still 250 jobs, but the state subsequently said that AMRI was to create 250 jobs with the help of other partners. The job goal now is 55 jobs, and the company reports having 58 employees in Buffalo, which meets its contractual requirement, according to Empire State Development. Any spin-off jobs that would help the project reach its goal of 250 total jobs are not tracked, the state agency said. Job creation goal: Partially met.   
• Buffalo Manufacturing Works: The state is investing $80 million in this facility for advanced manufacturing, and promised that it would create or retain 3,500 indirect jobs over 10 years. The state claims indirect jobs are being created, but it is not tracking them. One concrete job promise as part of this project: Edison Welding Institute, or EWI, was expected to create 30 to 35 jobs within five years, the state announced in March 2014. The center now employs 31 people. Another 30 jobs is expected following a recent expansion. Job creation goal: Partially met.     
• Buffalo Institute for Genomics and Data Analytics: Cuomo announced a $48 million investment from the Buffalo Billion in 2014. In July 2014, Empire State Development initially set a goal for the institute to create 490 jobs by Jan. 1, 2019. However, when the employment schedule was finalized in June 2015, the deadline was set at Feb. 1, 2024, according to ESD. An amendment this year pushed the deadline for the 490 jobs back to Feb. 1, 2025. The state agency now reports that the institute has helped create 51 new jobs and is on track to meet next year's cumulative goal of 70 new jobs. The institute has ""key industry partners"" that are expected to create over 200 jobs in Buffalo, and are ""on track"" to meet their commitment to create 490 jobs, according to the state. Job creation goal: Deadline moved, in progress. 
• Hotel Niagara: The state spent $4.4 million to acquire this Niagara Falls hotel for redevelopment. Billed as an ""upper-upscale"" 160-room hotel, it was expected to create 67 full-time permanent jobs and open in spring 2019. Construction is scheduled to start this fall, according to Empire State Development. Job creation goal: Project delayed.  
• Wonder Falls: Redevelopment of the former Rainbow Centre Mall site in Niagara Falls into a resort, creating 300 direct jobs, according to the governor’s office. The state announced in 2014 that Uniland would be the site developer. The state has not yet given Uniland any funding for the project. Empire State Development said Uniland is continuing its due diligence on this ""very complicated"" project. Job creation goal: Project delayed.   
• Athenex: The state invested $225 million in projects in Buffalo and Dunkirk, with a plan to create 1,400 direct and indirect jobs, 500 in Buffalo and 900 in Dunkirk, Cuomo announced on Feb. 11, 2016. In Dunkirk, the goal for direct jobs created is 450 within five years of completion of a new facility, at least 300 of which will be created within the first two-and-a-half years, according to a 2017 company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The facility is under construction. In Buffalo, the job commitment is 250 jobs by October 2020, according to Empire State Development. The state agency reports that there are 176 employees in Western New York, and that the company is ""on track"" to create 500 jobs between Buffalo and Dunkirk by 2022. The state is not tracking indirect jobs. Direct job creation goal: In progress. 
• Daemen College/Empire Visual Effects: Cuomo announced this initiative in July 2013, to invest $4.5 million to create a visual effects industry and 150 new jobs within five years. Empire Visual Effects is no longer part of the project, though Daemen College is still educating students to work in the field, according to the state. After receiving $637,000 of $2.5 million in funding, Empire Visual Effects failed to reach its job goals and was sued by the state. The state secured a judgement against the company in April. Daemen received $2 million for equipment and software. Job creation goal: Not met. 
 
Empire State Development’s upstate director of communications, Kristin Devoe, says Kolb is wrong and that ""projects funded by the ‘Buffalo Billion’ are meeting their contractual milestones."" 
Kolb’s spokesman, Michael Fraser, sent us a memo with links to news coverage of Buffalo Billion projects from local and national media. Many of the articles talked about the big promises that were made at the outset, and the subsequent failure or delay in meeting job targets. The memo noted that the state comptroller’s office is auditing the Buffalo Billion projects. 
Our ruling 
Kolb tweeted that the Buffalo Billion has broken every job promise. 
Kolb set a high bar by saying it had broken ""every"" promise. That isn't true. Some companies are meeting their contractual requirements. Others are at stages where it isn't clear whether they will make or miss the promised numbers.
But a project-by-project analysis shows many promises have been missed, and others have been changed since the deals were announced. Collectively, the analysis shows fewer jobs being created than originally promised.  
We rate Kolb’s claim Half True."

Lindsey Graham supports the Green New Deal.,"on Monday, October 28th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/28/blog-posting/no-lindsey-graham-does-not-support-green-new-deal/,Pants on Fire!,Bloggers,"No, Lindsey Graham does not support the Green New De","A tiny progressive advocacy PAC with less than $500 on hand bought an ad on Facebook as a media stunt. The Really Online Lefty League’s ad falsely showed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., endorsing the broad climate change policy known as the Green New Deal.
The Green New Deal calls for pretty much the entire country to mobilize and bring the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050 –– the point where it adds no more carbon to the atmosphere than is captured. Government action would be massive.
Graham, a firm conservative, has railed against the idea.
But in the ad, he says, ""We believe in the Green New Deal.""
The man behind the ad, Adriel Hampton, a communications strategist in San Francisco, said he got the idea from a House hearing when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
""Could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?"" Ocasio-Cortez asked.
Zuckerberg said, ""Probably.""
Here’s what viewers of the ad see and hear, and then, we provide what Graham actually said. 
The ad
The ad’s headline is ""Conservatives for a Green New Deal,"" and it displays in a corner throughout the minute-and-a-half long ad. It begins with video of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon talking about the need to protect the environment. Nixon oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and major amendments to both the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, two pillars of American environmental legislation.
The ad then shifts to a news conference with Graham at the podium.
""I’m Sen. Graham of South Carolina,"" Graham says. ""I’m here to announce with my colleagues that we care about conservation."" 
Graham’s voice continues as images of wind turbines and pine branches gently swaying in the breeze fill the screen. 
""We care about the environment,"" Graham continues. ""From a Republican point of view, I think we need to look at the science, admit that climate change is real. Simply put, we believe in the Green New Deal.""
For good measure, the ad shows a picture with Graham and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prime author of the Green New Deal, shoulder to shoulder at a rally, arms raised in victory.
The photo of Graham and Ocasio-Cortez is faked, as is his stated support for the Green New Deal 
The reality
The original photo was of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, taken in 2018. Graham’s head replaced Sanders’.
The audio editing of Graham’s news conference was masked by cutting away from the video of the event to add new images.
Here are key excerpts from Graham’s event.
""From a Republican point of view I think we need to showcase that we care about conservation –– we care about the environment,"" Graham said.
And then he went on:
""We have innovative solutions that are not top-down regulatory solutions,"" he said. ""We believe that you cannot have a healthy environment and destroy the economy and we believe that our friends on the other side care about the environment, but they care so much, they're going to destroy the economy.""
Graham did say, ""When nine out of ten scientists say that CO2 admissions are creating a greenhouse gas effect, that the planet is warming up, I believe the nine not the tenth.""
He did say ""look at the science, admit that climate change is real,"" but here’s what he said about the Green New Deal.
""There's not one Republican going to vote for anything coming out of the Green New Deal ‘cause it’s  crazy.""
Our ruling
An ad from the group The Really Online Lefty League says that Graham supports the Green New Deal. It edited his words to change their meaning, and added to the effect with a doctored photograph.

0,"The impeachment inquiry hearings ""going on behind closed doors over which Congressman Schiff is presiding—they are consistent with the rules"" of the U.S. House of Representatives.","on Monday, October 28th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/oct/28/andrew-napolitano/fox-news-analyst-correct-impeachment-inquiry-follo/,True,Andrew Napolitano,x News analyst correct: Impeachment inquiry is following rules by questioning witnesses in private | Pund,"Republicans recently stormed a hearing in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry targeting President Donald Trump to protest the fact that witnesses are being questioned in private.
The next day, Fox News political commentator and legal analyst Andrew Napolitano sought to correct them.
Before even being asked a question, Napolitano began his Oct. 24 appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" with a statement about the hearings being led by U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of one of three House committees holding the hearings.
""I read the House rules,"" the former New Jersey judge said. ""And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors — the hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding — they are consistent with the rules.""
He’s right.
Impeachment 101
Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower’s report suggesting that Trump withheld U.S. military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. 
A president can be impeached if his or her acts are inconsistent with their presidential duties, whether or not it violates criminal law. It is the job of the House to decide whether there’s enough evidence to show that Trump committed an impeachable offense. First, articles of impeachment would have to pass the full U.S. House of Representatives with a simple majority. Those articles would then be sent to the Senate for a trial. A two-thirds Senate vote is required to convict — that is, remove — the president. 
Impeachment is part of the U.S. Constitution. But the rules and procedures for an impeachment are not written in the Constitution, or in a statute; they depend largely on historical precedent. 
Napolitano’s position
After making his statement on ""Fox & Friends,"" Napolitano went on to explain that the impeachment inquiry rules were adopted in 2015 by House Republicans and allow for initial interviews of witnesses to be done in secret, much like a criminal case is presented to a grand jury. Any formal impeachment hearing, he added, would have to be done in public, as would a Senate trial.
When we asked a Fox News representative for information to support Napolitano’s statement, she sent the following from Napolitano:
""The House rules permit committee chairs to hold closed hearings on matters of national security or intelligence. Diplomatic matters implicate both national security and intelligence. The rules also permit standing committees – as opposed to the full House – to issue subpoenas. As well, they permit interviews of witnesses in secret in order to determine if they are credible enough to present in public.""
Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky told us that according to the House of Representatives’ House Practice book, ""an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges."" And no such resolution was done in this inquiry.
But the day after Napolitano’s interview, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the impeachment inquiry is legal. 
And Napolitano’s statement was not about in the inquiry generally, but whether interviews can be done in private.
Experts agree with Napolitano
Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri professor of law and author of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump,"" told us the hearings are not ""secret"" in that they are open to members of the three House committees (roughly 100 lawmakers), along with their staff. Bowman pointed us to the 2015 House rules that allow for the private questioning of witnesses in impeachment inquiries.
The rules say House meetings shall be open to the public except when a committee or subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, ""determines by record vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, or otherwise would violate a law or rule of the House.""
Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University and co-author of ""Impeachment: An American History,"" underscored the House’s wide latitude.
He told PolitiFact that from a constitutional standpoint, ""the House can choose whatever rules it wants for impeachment hearings—just as the Senate will be able to do the same for its trial, relying on precedent but not bound by it.""
One more point before we close.
When Republicans controlled the House, its Benghazi committee held nearly all of its hearings behind closed doors, Allan Lichtman, American University history professor and author of ""The Case for Impeachment,"" noted to us. He also pointed out that in the final House report on the matter, then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, said: 
""The committee’s preference for private interviews over public hearings has been questioned. Interviews are a more efficient and effective means of discovery. Interviews allow witnesses to be questioned in depth by a highly prepared member or staff person. In a hearing, every member of a committee is recognized — usually for five minutes — a procedure which precludes in-depth in-depth focused questioning. Interviews also allow the committee to safeguard the privacy of witnesses who may fear retaliation for cooperating or whose work requires anonymity, such as intelligence community operatives.""
Our ruling
Napolitano said: ""I read the House rules. And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors—the (impeachment inquiry) hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding—they are consistent with the rules.""
House rules give House committees wide latitude in how to conduct impeachment inquiries and they allow for witnesses to be questioned with only members of the committees and their staffs present.
We rate Napolitano’s statement True."

The resolution rebuked the Democratic-led House for interviewing impeachment witnesses behind closed doors and not holding a formal vote to initiate the inquiry. 
It also argued that Trump, who faces impeachment for urging Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 election, has not received ""fundamental constitutional protections.""
""The House of Representatives is abandoning more than a century’s worth of precedent and tradition in impeachment proceedings and denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American,"" Graham wrote in the resolution.
But Graham’s claim that Trump has been denied due process — a claim he has repeated on Twitter and in Congress — does not square with the law or the way impeachment works.
One of the cornerstones of American jurisprudence is due process – the right to confront your accuser, call witnesses on your behalf, and challenge the accusations against you. None of this is occurring in the House.— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 24, 2019 
We looked into the same ""due process"" claim when it showed up in a White House letter indicating that Trump would not be cooperating with the inquiry. At the time, constitutional scholars told us that complaint lacks legal footing. 
The House impeaches, the Senate holds the trial
In his resolution, Graham wrote that due process for Trump would mean ""the right to confront your accuser, call witnesses on your behalf, and challenge the accusations against you."" 
Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop pointed to a presentation Graham showed during a press conference listing rights Graham said President Bill Clinton had when he was impeached, such as the right to have counsel at hearings and the right to challenge evidence, among others. (The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from Clinton’s White House counsel, but there’s no constitutional provision requiring it to do so.)

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks about his resolution during a news conference in Washington on Oct. 24, 2019. (AP/Applewhite)​
But when we checked out the White House’s letter, Vanderbilt University law professor Suzanna Sherry told us ""there is nothing that requires Congress to give the president any of the opportunities"" that Graham, like the White House attorney before him, described.
If such rights apply at all, they would be granted to Trump during the trial phase, which the Constitution says takes place in the Senate. The House’s job is to determine whether there’s enough evidence to show that the president committed an impeachable offense.
Sherry told us that ""an impeachment investigation is analogous to a criminal investigation or inquiry by the police, prosecutor or grand jury"" and that ""the accused has none of the rights"" that White House counsel Pat Cipollone listed in the White House’s letter and Graham listed in his resolution.
""In particular, neither the accused nor his or her lawyer are present at a grand jury hearing, nor is the accused permitted to present witnesses or other evidence or see a transcript,"" she said.
""It is only after charges have been filed and the case has reached the trial stage that criminal defendants have the right to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, have access to evidence, and have counsel present,"" said former federal prosecutor and Stanford Law professor David Sklansky, adding that the due process complaint is ""not a good argument.""
""The role of the House of Representatives in an impeachment proceeding is to investigate and charge, not to try,"" he said. ""The trial comes later, in the Senate.""
Even in the Senate, however, it’s not clear that impeachment proceedings require due process protections, because conviction results only in removal from office, experts said.
Writing for Reason, Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said due process rights are protected in ""situations where an individual stands to lose her ‘life, liberty, or property,’ none of which is at risk here.""
""To suggest that due process requires that a president facing only loss of office get more rights at the accusatory stage than a criminal defendant facing loss of liberty or even life is not only constitutionally unsupportable, but ludicrous,"" said Frank O. Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.
The Constitution lets the House set the rules
Graham’s resolution criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s handling of the impeachment inquiry and the fact that she has not held a formal vote to authorize the inquiry.
The Constitution says that the House ""shall have the sole Power of Impeachment"" and the Senate ""shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.""
In the past, the full House has authorized impeachment inquiries, and then the House Judiciary Committee has taken the lead in conducting the investigations, holding hearings on proposed articles of impeachment, and voting on whether to approve them. The final vote on impeachment is by the full House before it moves to Senate for trial.
Pelosi has not held a vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry (a majority say they approve of an inquiry), but instead instructed three committees — Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs — to carry out an investigation that Judiciary will use to draft any articles of impeachment. While her process has been different, historians told us Pelosi does not need to hold a full House vote.
In the only Supreme Court case where due process issues were raised — a 1993 ruling on the Senate impeachment trial of Judge Walter Nixon — the court found that the Senate’s process was ""nonjusticiable,"" which Bowman said means ""a matter not to be resolved by the courts."" 
But a federal judge in Washington on Oct. 25 called the idea that a full House vote is required to initiate impeachment proceedings ""fatally flawed."" In a 75-page district court opinion, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote, ""Even in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry.""
""All that matters for legitimacy for the House proceedings is to follow the rules of the House as they currently stand and the Constitution,"" said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina in Chapel-Hill.
As the House moves forward, Pelosi could elect to let Trump’s lawyers to participate. Sklansky told us that former President Richard Nixon’s lawyer was allowed to question witnesses called by the House Judiciary Committee and to recommend other witnesses to be called, and that Clinton’s lawyers were also permitted to call and question witnesses called by the committee.
At the end of the day, the Constitution gives the House the right to decide how to proceed.
Our ruling
In the resolution, Graham wrote that House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are ""denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American.""
Constitutional scholars said due process rights are not necessarily guaranteed to a president during an impeachment inquiry. If they were, they would be granted during the Senate trial, not the House’s evidence-gathering process.
We rate this statement False.

One post published Oct. 21 and shared more than 1,300 times says the following:
""Does anyone else find it strange: The same woman who paid for a Russian dossier to win an election; Whose husband made $500k for a Russian speech; Who sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia; Whose foundation received $150M from Russia; Keeps calling others Russian assets?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
As evidence, the post cited Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. We found an Oct. 20 tweet from Kirk that makes the same claims as the post. It was retweeted more than 26,000 times.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
PolitiFact has investigated four of these claims in the past.
We summarized our findings to address each of the post’s claims. The post contains a hint of truth, but it paints an inaccurate picture of Clinton’s ties to Russia.
Hillary Clinton ""paid for a Russian dossier to win an election""
This contains an element of truth, but it isn’t the full picture.
The dossier that the Facebook post is referencing was written by former British spy Christopher Steele about President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. Many of the details included in the dossier were salacious but unverified. It was not written by Russian officials, as the Facebook post seems to claim.
In September 2018, we fact-checked a claim from Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., about the dossier, Fusion GPS (the opposition research firm that created it) and how the Clinton campaign was involved. We found that Fusion GPS was hired to work on behalf of the Clinton campaign, but the firm was already investigating Trump at the time.
Fusion GPS was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative media website. The Democratic National Committee, through its law firm Perkins Coie and for the benefit of the Clinton campaign, hired the opposition research firm to collect information after Trump won the Republican nomination. Then, Fusion GPS hired Steele to produce memos on Trump’s ties to Russia.
Bill Clinton ""made $500k for a Russian speech""
This is accurate. The source of the claim is the 2015 book ""Clinton Cash"" by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. During an April 2015 interview about the book on Fox News Sunday, he said something that caught our eye: ""Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state.""
We rated that claim True. And in the course of our investigation of Clinton’s federal financial disclosure forms, we found that former President Clinton gave a talk in 2010 to a Russian finance corporation. He was compensated $500,000.
Hillary Clinton ""sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia""
This is misleading. We rated a similar claim Mostly False.
The claim also stems from Schweizer’s ""Clinton Cash."" A chapter of the book suggests a pay-for-play scheme between the Clintons and Russia, accusing them of transferring uranium in exchange for donation money.
Part of that chapter stems from a 2007 deal between Clinton Foundation board member Frank Giustra’s company, UrAsia, and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company. Uranium One has mines, mills and land in U.S. states equal to about 20% of the American uranium production capacity. Its actual production, though, is a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the United States, at 11% in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.
RELATED: In context: Hillary Clinton on Tulsi Gabbard, the Trump campaign, Russia
In 2009, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, bought a 17% share of Uranium One. A year later, it bought enough shares to give it a 51% stake.
Since a foreign entity was taking a majority stake in a uranium operation, several U.S. government regulators had to approve the deal. They did, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100% ownership of Uranium One and renamed it Uranium One Holding.
In our previous fact-check, we noted that Clinton sat on the committee that approved the sale — but the decision was not hers alone. She also did not have the power to veto the committee’s decision.
The Clinton Foundation ""received $150M from Russia""
This is exaggerated. We rated a similar claim Mostly False.
Nine people related to Uranium One donated to the Clinton Foundation. But the bulk of the money, about $131 million, came from Giustra — a businessman from Canada, not Russia.
Giustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state.
We haven’t independently verified Giustra’s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly — from $145 million to $4 million.
Our ruling
A Facebook post makes four claims about Hillary Clinton’s ties to Russia before and during the 2016 presidential election.
The first, that Clinton ""paid for a Russian dossier to win an election,"" contains a hint of truth (that the Clinton campaign paid the firm that wrote the Steele dossier), but it isn’t the full picture. It’s true that Bill Clinton once made $500,000 by giving a speech to a Russian company. The claim that Clinton ""sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia"" exaggerates the percentage involved and Clinton's role; she didn’t have sole decision-making power over the deal. And it’s an exaggeration to say that the Clinton Foundation ""received $150M from Russia"" — it may be closer to $4 million from Uranium One investors.
The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False."

That’s what one viral Facebook post claims:
""Olive Garden is funding Trump's re-election in 2020. It would be terrible if you shared this and Olive Garden lost business.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
But it isn’t true. A quick Google search into the rumor turns up several news articles and fact-checks that debunk the claim. We also previously fact-checked an Instagram post that inaccurately included Olive Garden on a list of companies that allegedly donated to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.
The rumors started to circulate on social media in late August after that list went viral. Shortly after a #BoycottOliveGarden hashtag began trending on Twitter, the restaurant’s official account stepped in:
""We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.""
We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.— Olive Garden (@olivegarden) August 26, 2019 
When a user responded to the tweet and asked whether Olive Garden’s parent company, Darden Restaurants, donated to PACs, the restaurant responded that Darden ""does not donate to any federal or presidential candidates."" Darden owns multiple restaurant chains, including LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s and The Capital Grille.
We went to OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance database run by the Center for Responsive Politics research group, to examine the numbers.
The database shows that Darden Restaurants itself has not donated to Trump’s re-election campaign, nor has it made any contributions during the 2020 election cycle. (The same goes for the 2018 and 2016 election cycles.)
That’s because corporations are prohibited from making contributions to candidates and party committees, according to the Federal Election Commission. Open Secrets includes a similar disclaimer that reads: ""Organizations themselves cannot contribute to candidates and party committees. Totals include subsidiaries and affiliates.""
But donations can be made from PACs affiliated with the company, from the organization’s employees, owners or those individuals’ immediate family members. All the money associated with Darden that’s been donated so far in the 2020 cycle has come from individuals, the database shows. Those donations have totaled $17,332, with $11,899 of that going to candidates, all of them Democrats, and $5,000 going to a PAC that says it supports Democratic leadership. Trump is not among the recipients so far, according to the database.
In recent election cycles, however, contributions associated with the organization went to both Republican and Democratic candidates and committees, and came from both individuals and PACs. In the 2016 election, individuals affiliated with Darden – again, not the organization itself – donated $8,407 to Hillary Clinton and $886 to Donald Trump.
Our ruling
A viral Facebook post claims that Olive Garden is ""funding"" Trump’s re-election campaign.
However, campaign finance data shows that Olive Garden’s parent company, Darden Restaurants, has not donated to Trump’s re-election campaign. Corporations are prohibited from making contributions to campaigns or party committees. Meanwhile, PAC’s associated with the company, as well as individual employees and their family members, have made contributions to both Democratic and Republican candidates.

Trump said that he made the warning in his January 2000 book ""The America We Deserve.""
Speaking to reporters Oct. 27, Trump said that he doesn’t get credit for warning that bin Laden should have been taken out.
""You know, if you read my book — there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down. And I don’t get any credit for this, but that’s okay. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book — a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, ‘There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.’ Something to that effect. ‘He’s big trouble.’""
Trump continued, saying that he said to people, ""Take out Osama bin Laden,"" although ""nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center.
""But about a year — you’ll have to check — a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, ‘You have to kill him. You have to take him out.’ Nobody listened to me.""
Trump made a similar statement in a speech as a presidential candidate in Virginia in 2015. We rated that statement Mostly False. At other speeches in 2015, Trump went further and said he ""predicted"" bin Laden and terrorism.
Trump did write about bin Laden critically in his book, but he did not suggest that he be taken out.
What Trump actually wrote about bin Laden
Bin Laden is mentioned once in the book, specifically in a passage criticizing President Bill Clinton’s approach to national security:
""Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, stand offs, and hot spots. We’re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We’re playing tournament chess - one master against many rivals. One day we’re assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything’s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we’re told that a shadowy figure named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later, it’s on to a new enemy and a new crisis."" (Emphasis in bold is ours.)
Trump’s reference to bin Laden relates to the Aug. 20, 1998, U.S. bombing of his camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. Clinton said they were in retaliation for terrorist bombings earlier that month on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and wounding thousands. Clinton said the goal of the U.S. strikes was to ""disrupt bin Laden’s terror network.""
Trump devoted a chapter to terrorism and warned broadly that America could be attacked, but he did not call for taking out bin Laden. He wrote that the U.S. ""must prepare for the real possibility that somewhere, sometime, a weapon of mass destruction will be carried into a major American city and detonated."" 
Trump acknowledged that this was not his original thought, noting that ABC-TV’s ""Nightline"" had aired a series of shows about the threat. 
In his comments to the media Oct. 27, Trump also said that ""al-Baghdadi everybody hears because he’s built this monster for a long time. But nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center."" 
The United States government was aware of bin Laden a few years before the Sept. 11 attacks. The CIA established a unit in 1996, Alec Station, to hunt bin Laden when he was calling for global jihad. The station was disbanded a decade later.
Our ruling
Trump said that in his 2000 book ""I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, ‘You have to kill him. You have to take him out.’""
Trump inaccurately recounted what he wrote in his own book. The only kernel of truth here is that Trump did write about bin Laden in the context of criticizing President Clinton.
Trump’s book warned about terrorism, as did others by 2000, but he did not write that bin Laden should be taken out.

0,"Says ""red flag laws"" allow gun seizure without a judge’s involvement: ""They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it.""","on Monday, October 28th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/28/robin-vos/do-red-flag-laws-allow-gun-seizure-without-judges-/,Mostly False,Robin Vos,Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge’s OK? | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"The partisan divide over gun control in Wisconsin is as stark as it has ever been.
Frustrated by a lack of Republican action on the topic, Gov. Tony Evers has called a special session of the state Legislature. He wanted lawmakers to take up a so-called ""red flag"" law — which would allow judges to take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger — and an expansion of gun background checks to include sales between private parties.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald promptly announced he would likely adjourn the session as soon as it began, refusing to even vote on the proposals.
Meanwhile, the state Legislature’s other lead Republican — Assembly Speaker Robin Vos — has been making the media rounds to defend Republican inaction and condemn Evers’ proposals.
That included a Facebook Live interview with WTJM-TV’s Charles Benson on Oct. 22, 2019. Their conversation turned to red flag laws, also referred to as emergency risk protection orders. Here’s part of that exchange:
Vos — Red flags laws, it’s basically like saying we are going to take away your car because we think you could drive drunk. It’s crazy.
Benson — But a judge has to decide that.
Vos — No, they take away your weapon first, then you have to go and ask permission to get the weapon back.
Vos later reiterated his description while criticizing how the Marquette University Law School poll summarized red flag laws as ""allowing the police to take guns away from people who have been found by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others."" In late August, the poll showed 81% of respondents in support.
""That’s not the way the red flag law works,"" said Vos, R-Rochester. ""They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it.""
Is Vos right that red flag laws allow guns to be seized before a judge gets involved?
Let’s dig in.
The background
Red flag laws provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others.
The first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1990, but the second didn’t appear until Indiana’s in 2005. More states have adopted such laws in recent years in the wake of mass shootings by people who had exhibited earlier warning signs.
At least 17 states and the District of Columbia now have a red flag law, including several passed in 2019, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. Every state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, 12  allow family or household members to as well, and a smattering of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, co-workers or school officials.
!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"");
Typically, a judge (or other judicial official such as a court commissioner) hears the request and then decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the gun owner. These orders are temporary and last from two to 21 days depending on the state, according to an issue brief put together by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. The gun owner then has a chance to make his or her case at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year.
Different states have different burdens of proof that must be met for a judge to issue an order, such as finding the individual poses a ""significant risk"" or that there is ""clear and convincing evidence.""
If an order is issued, some states require guns be turned over immediately, while others allow a short period of time. A search warrant authorizing seizure can also be issued in some states.
Evers’ proposed red flag law for Wisconsin requires a hearing within 14 days of the preliminary order, and makes a final order valid for a year. It says guns should be seized if the judge finds ""reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely"" to harm themselves or others. Requests can be made to either extend the final order or end it early.
State law already requires guns be surrendered as a result of other judicial findings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders, according to the Legislative Council.
Vos’ defense
You may have noticed the word ""judge"" appeared frequently in the summary above.
The Wisconsin proposal — contrary to Vos’ description — doesn’t allow any guns to be seized without a judicial order.
Asked for evidence that judges aren’t initially involved in red flag law seizures, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer said Vos misheard the question.
""Speaker Vos thought Charles Benson had asked if the accused goes before a judge prior to an order to surrender,"" Beyer said.
But that explanation doesn’t strike us as reasonable.
Benson’s initial question about the red flag law was far less specific – asking if Vos thinks Wisconsin residents want to see it passed. And Vos’ second reference to a lack of judicial sign-off came after Benson simply read the wording of the Marquette poll.
Descriptions of red flag laws consistently refer to decisions being made by judges. That’s the terminology used by Giffords, the Legislative Council, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the New York Times and many others.
But there is an exception.
Indiana’s law allows police to seize firearms without first obtaining a judicial order. However, they must then submit a statement to a judge, who can overturn the officer’s decision and refuse to issue a preliminary order, according to Giffords. Similar to other states, that preliminary order requires a hearing on a final order be held within 14 days.
Beyer said Vos’ primary concern with the red flag laws relates to due process, since the preliminary order can be issued without the individual having a chance to dispute it. That is a core objection from other conservatives and groups that oppose red flag laws as well, including the National Rifle Association.
Red flag laws have been challenged in other states, but courts have upheld them as constitutional on both Second Amendment and due process grounds, the Legislative Council said. That includes a ruling upholding the Florida law in September 2019.
Our ruling
Vos said red flag laws mean ""they take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it.""
But red flag laws — including the one proposed in Wisconsin — don’t typically work like that. They involve police or family petitioning a judge, who must sign a preliminary order before any guns can be seized.

0,"Says that in Illinois, ""fewer than 20% of those actually deported have been charged with any serious crime.""","on Sunday, October 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/oct/27/richard-durbin/durbin-mostly-track-claim-illinois-deportations/,Mostly True,Richard Durbin,Durbin mostly on track with claim on Illinois deportations | PolitiFact Illinois,"At a Senate hearing on a bill aimed at local governments that limit their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin criticized the agency for not focusing its resources on immigrants who pose a threat to public safety.
""You’re not going after dangerous people, you’re going after people who are here undocumented,"" Durbin told the agency’s associate director of enforcement and removal operations. ""I can tell you the statistics in Illinois, where it turns out that fewer than 20% of those actually deported have been charged with any serious crime.""
Is Durbin correct that less than a quarter of immigrants deported from Illinois have serious criminal charges in their background?
When asked to provide support for the statement, a spokesperson for the senator pointed to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which maintains figures on the number of individuals who departed from a given state at the time of their deportation and provides the classification for their most serious criminal conviction, if any was listed by ICE.
In the first 11 months of the 2018 fiscal year, 853 individuals were deported out of Illinois, 160 of whom were classified as having as having serious criminal convictions, according to TRAC’s data, which it obtains via public records requests from ICE. The agency classifies offense codes into three levels, the most serious of which covers what it considers ""aggravated felonies,"" a list of crimes laid out in federal immigration law that has expanded over the years and includes both violent and non-violent offenses.
That amounts to less than 20% of total deportations from Illinois, as Durbin claimed. But the data has some limitations.
While TRAC’s director, Susan Long, pointed us to the same dataset as Durbin, she added an important caveat.
""How ‘Illinois’ deportations are defined, as well as what is considered ‘charged with any serious crime’ will make a difference,"" she said.
Other experts we contacted made a similar point: The location from which an individual departs the country is not necessarily where they resided prior to their arrest or even where they were arrested before deportation. Those are details ICE does not provide, according to Long.
""The removal dataset doesn’t tell you anything about the history of the person,"" said Guillermo Cantor, research director at the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, who has also analyzed deportation data from ICE. ""You only know where the person was deported from … But that doesn’t have a lot of meaning in terms of analysis, because that person may have resided anywhere in the country.""
Cantor and others also noted the data could represent arrests made several years ago, meaning it may not say much about the agency’s current policies under the Trump administration, which was the focus of Durbin’s criticism.
""Today’s deportees out of Illinois might have actually been arrested by ICE three years ago in some cases,"" said Randy Capps, a research director at the Migration Policy Institute. He pointed to TRAC data cataloging the backlog of pending deportation cases, which show that in 2018, cases in Illinois remained open for 963 days on average. The wait time has since fallen slightly.
What’s more, the limited figures ICE provides to TRAC and others show the share of deportations involving convictions for what the agency deems serious crimes was relatively small during the Obama years as well — ranging from a 12.4% low for all deportations out of Illinois in 2009 to a high of 24.1% in 2015, after the Obama administration shifted its focus to individuals more likely to pose a threat to public safety.
Capps said another set of federal data maintained by TRAC provides a more current picture of state-by-state enforcement trends under Trump. It shows ICE arrests of noncitizens with serious convictions in Illinois dropped from more than a third of the total in 2015 to a little over one-fifth in 2018. Meanwhile, the share of arrests involving individuals with no background of criminal convictions rose from 11% to 43%.
Our ruling
Durbin said that in Illinois, less than 20% of immigrants who are deported ""have been charged with any serious crime.""
Limited federal backs that up, but it comes with a few caveats — most notably the fact that the available count includes all individuals who departed from Illinois at the time of their deportation. That means they may have resided and been arrested in a state other than Illinois before leaving the country.
We rate Durbin’s claim Mostly True.

The Facebook post making the rounds claims that, in 1770, the British Parliament ""banned lipstick, saying it had the power to seduce men into marriage, which was classified as witchcraft.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Was the cosmetic really once banned under British law? We wanted to find out. 
It’s accurate that during the 16th century (and beyond) people had very strong opinions about makeup and its ability to deceive the eye. One 1711 letter written to British newspaper The Spectator about the use of makeup said that men who had married women who didn’t ""let their husbands see their faces until they are married"" were ""injured gentlemen.""
However maligned some men may have felt about the deception of painted lips, we could find no evidence that a lipstick ban ever made its way through Parliament at any time.
A 2017 article by Racked, Vox’s now defunct fashion-focused website, dove into the rumors that a law passed in England in 1770, supposedly called the ""Hoops and Heels Act,"" that made it legal for a man to divorce his wife if she had tricked him into marriage using ""witchcraft"" to enhance her looks. The story says:
""Called the Hoops and Heels Act, it stated that any woman who tried to ‘seduce and betray into matrimony’ a man using ‘scents, paints, cosmetic washes, artificial teeth, false hair, Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled shoes, [or] bolstered hips’ would be tried for witchcraft and have her marriage voided if found guilty.
""Except it never happened. But generations of researchers have been fooled, some stating that the law was passed in 1774, others saying that it was voted down by Parliament, and another group claiming that under the counsel of their mistresses and wives, members of Parliament decided not to vote on it at all.""
So despite iterations of the claim proliferating the internet for years, there was no British law that instituted a lipstick ban.
Fact-checking website Africa Check found that the closest thing to such a law came in a June 7, 1650, entry in the House of Commons Journal under the heading ""Immodest Dress."" 
That entry says: ""An Act against the Vice of Painting, and wearing black Patches, and immodest Dresses of Women, be read on Friday Morning next.""
But officials with the United Kingdom’s National Archives told PolitiFact in an email that the bill never had a full reading, as far as they could see, and because of that ""it was likely introduced at the behest of a Puritan MP (member of parliament) but the Council of State chose not to pursue it.""
While 1770s society may have considered painted lips and makeup in general to be unladylike witchcraft, a law banning it never succeeded.
Feminine trickery marches on. Pants on Fire!"

Fast-forward seven months and we’re looking at a nearly identical post — only this statement is attributed to the late advice columnist Ann Landers.
""At age 20, we worry about what others think of us,"" begins the Oct. 17 post titled ""Aging Gracefully."" ""At age 40, we don’t care what they think. At age 60, we discover that they have not been thinking of us at all."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We reached out to AnnLanders.com to ask about the Facebook post but did not immediately hear back. We read the columns about aging on the site and she doesn’t dole out the advice in the posts there or share its sentiments in different words.
In a chapter about aging in her 1961 book, ""Since You Asked Me,"" Landers writes: ""Many who write are panic-stricken at the thought of leaving their 20s behind. More are terrified at the prospect of the Big 40. … For many, the fortieth birthday is a traumatic experience.""
She also says that ""age is important only to the very young and to the very insecure"" and she criticizes beauty products marketed to help women stay young while also encouraging her female readers to stay thin and go easy on the makeup after age 45 because ""a heavy foundation base and too much powder or rouge accentuates the wrinkles.""
But a reader pointed us to a 1992 syndicated column in which Landers includes this ""Gem of the Day"" after responding to two readers’ queries. It says: ""At 20, we worry about what others think of us. At 40, we don’t care what they think of us. At 60, we discover that they haven’t been thinking of us at all.""
However, it doesn’t appear that Landers is the original source of this statement or of its many variations. Eppie Lederer became Ann Landers in 1955 and responded to her first letters under the columnist pseudonym that year. She was born in 1918 and was still a teenager when a column by humorist Robert Quillen was published in newspapers with this line in August 1934: ""At 20 we don’t care what the world thinks of us; at 30 we worry about what it thinks of us; at 40 we discover it doesn’t think of us."" 
And in 1935, according to the website quoteinvestigator.com, Will Rogers says this starring as a newspaper columnist in the movie ""Life Begins at 40:"" ""At 20, we don’t care what the world thinks of us. At 30, we worry about what it thinks of us. At 40, we’re sure it doesn’t think of us."" 
We rate this post Half True.
Update, Oct. 28, 2019: This story was originally rated False with the caveat that if evidence emerged showing that Ann Landers did say this, we’d reconsider our ruling. A reader pointed us to one of her 1992 columns that includes a version of this statement but she is not its original source."

The vote is set to end Friday. Union workers’ demands have centered around health care benefits, better wages and job protection. Some of the deal’s terms for hourly workers include a 3% wage increase in an employee’s second and fourth year with the company, a $60,000 bonus for 2,000 eligible production and 60 skilled workers who are set to retire, and protections on vacation time.
Part of the argument made by UAW Local 2250 President Glenn Kage was that the union has helped GM remain financially stable over the course of the past decade. Local 2250 is the UAW chapter for the Wentzville, Missouri GM plant that manufactures full-sized vans.
""General Motors is making record profits,"" Kage said in a Sept. 16 interview with the Missouri Times, ""and they can’t do so without the hard work of our members who have earned pay increases, earned better benefits, earned for our temporary workers to be converted to permanent workers, earned job protections.""
Whether GM is making record profits depends on the time period.
""My first question would be: for when? Because profits, as an accounting concept, is measured over a period of time, like a quarter or a year. So when someone just says record profits, they're leaving something (out),"" said Tim Howald, an adjunct accountancy and finance professor at the University of Missouri.
In 2014, GM's quarterly profits were moving in a steady upward direction, eventually leading into a record year in 2015.
According to GM’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, GM’s income was $9.7 billion for 2015, up from $2.8 billion in 2014. The increase leveled off in 2016, when income was $9.4 billion.
The increased profits in 2015 can be attributed, in part, to the increased demand for high-margin pickup trucks and utility vehicles. The so-called Detroit Big Three manufacturers — GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler — specialize in these vehicles.
They are popular at a time when ""we’re selling the most expensive vehicles we ever have,"" said Bernard Swiecki, director of the Automotive Communities Partnership at the Center for Automotive Research.
""Then within that is the move towards trucks and also crossover vehicles, which are cars that look like trucks,"" he said. ""Essentially because they are more profitable than sedans, that's driving higher profits for all automakers, but for the Detroit three in particular, because they dominate pickup trucks.""
Part of what drove the profit increase also led to the strike.
""GM had about a million units of unused sedan capacity,"" Swiecki said. ""That brings us right back around to why they're making money — the market moved to trucks and that's good, in a way, because you get a more profitable GM. But (it’s) bad if you happen to be a GM manufacturing employee who’s in a sedan plant.""
Comparatively, in 2017, the company lost $3.9 billion. This was due, in part, to adjustments to new tax laws. GM recovered in 2018 with a net income of $7.9 billion, but that wasn’t record-setting.
Our ruling
Kage said, ""General Motors is making record profits."" According to GM’s SEC filings, GM had record profits in 2015, but not in the past two years, when GM’s profits have actually been decreasing. Although the recent years’ profits are higher than they were in the early to mid 2010s, they still aren’t considered record-setting.

Locally, renewable energy companies that fund wind energy projects in Missouri have recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, just south of Harrisburg.
Now, a widely-circulated chain email has resurfaced a claim industry experts have seen all too often: ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States.""
This isn’t true. Wind energy proponents have been trying to dispel the claim for years, and 14,000 seems to be a fabricated number. The trouble is no one can say exactly how many ""abandoned"" wind turbines there are.
Abandoned wind turbines
Much of the email chain’s content appears to have been copied from an article on a blog site called American Elephants, which describes itself as a home of conservatives. The anonymous blog post was published July 7, 2013, meaning this claim is at least six years old.
Wind energy experts have been trying to debunk this claim as a myth for just as long.
""It’s bullshit,"" said Paul Gipe, who has published five books on wind energy since 1995 and who has closely studied California’s wind farms. (Now the American Wind Energy Association does that.)
Gipe said there have never been 14,000 abandoned wind turbines in California, in the United States, in North America or anywhere in the world. But at one time, there were approximately 14,000 wind turbines in California, total. He says he is ""the author of that number"" and believes that it is the origin of the 14,000 figure used in the email chain.
Experts from the wind energy association agree that the claim is blatantly false, but the organization has struggled to correct the misconception.
""We know for a fact that it’s not true,"" said Kaitlin Monaghan, the association’s deputy director of permitting and asset management policy. ""We’re not sure why it’s been so hard for us to myth-bust it or why it’s kind of still floating around out there, but I think sometimes that’s how it goes.""
James Owen, executive director of Renew Energy, a company that champions renewable energy , said he doesn’t know of any abandoned wind turbines in the state of Missouri. He, too, agreed that there is no evidence for the abandoned turbines claim.
""To the extent I’ve seen, there’s absolutely no basis for that,"" Owen said. ""It just seems like a number that was made up.""
Why it wouldn’t happen
Monaghan acknowledged that wind turbines age and typically have a useful life of 20 to 30 years. At that time, she said old equipment must be taken down, repaired or replaced.
If a project owner chooses to close a wind farm completely, Monaghan explained, it is the responsibility of the owner to decommission the farm, which includes removing wind turbines and restoring the land to its original state. She said there are often local and state laws that require this of individuals operating wind farms.
However, 99% of wind projects are built on private land, so lease contracts for land used for turbines often include requirements for project owners to remove turbines and restore land when a project is shut down, Monaghan said.
With this in mind, Monaghan explained that there are a number of reasons why project owners would not simply ""abandon"" wind turbines — meaning leave turbines standing despite not being functional. In areas where constructing wind farms requires permits, a project owner must often provide a detailed plan upfront for the eventual decommissioning of the project. Sometimes, owners will even have to provide a ""parent company guarantee,"" or some sort of financial backing, to reassure the community that no abandoned wind turbines will be left behind.
On top of this, Monaghan said it would hurt companies’ reputations with landowners if they simply abandoned wind turbines. Turbines also have salvage value; the steel and other materials from a project could be repurposed or sold, Monaghan said.
Finally, preexisting farms have already collected extensive wind speed data and have access to transmission lines. Greg Alvarez, deputy director of external communications for the wind energy association, explained that these features are valuable for projects and create ""very, very strong financial incentives to not let these sites sit vacant and abandoned.""
As for those who believe companies are installing wind turbines to get a tax credit and then abandoning them, Owen said that was a ""patently absurd"" idea because companies only make money by selling power generated by the turbines. He said it was also a misunderstanding of the tax credit available.
""The tax credits they’re talking about are production tax credits,"" Owen said, ""so they don’t get the tax credit unless they’re producing something.""
No hard numbers
The U.S. Wind Turbine Database indicates that there are 60,576 turbines operating in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and Guam. In total, wind energy supplies just under 7% of the country’s electricity, according to Alvarez. He said the U.S. wind industry has 97,000 megawatts of installed capacity, which is enough to power about 30 million average American homes.
Energy production is tracked and recorded, as is the installation of wind turbines, but no one is tracking the number of abandoned wind turbines.
The wind energy association's experts said that at most, there is a small number of nonoperational wind turbines that may appear to be abandoned even if they are not. Beyond that, they couldn’t be more specific.
Gipe’s best estimate of the actual number of abandoned U.S. wind turbines was somewhere ""in the hundreds"" but not the thousands.
Our ruling
The email chain argues that ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States."" There is not now, nor has there ever been, research to support the claim. Industry experts have been fighting to debunk the myth for years.

0,"Says Congress gave Wall Street ""trillions of dollars of zero interest loans.""","on Friday, October 25th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/25/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-overstates-recession-aid-wall-stree/,Half-True,Bernie Sanders,Bernie Sanders overstates recession aid to Wall Street banks,"Sen. Bernie Sanders marked his return to the campaign trail after a heart attack with a huge outdoor rally in New York City. Sanders stayed focused on his core message that corporate power drives government policy at the expense of hundreds of millions of Americans. 
On student debt, Sanders said he would cancel every bit of it with money from a new tax on financial transactions.
""If Congress eleven years ago, against my vote, could bail out the crooks on Wall Street and provide them with trillions of dollars of zero interest loans,"" Sanders said Oct. 19. ""You know what? We can cancel all student debt in America with a modest tax on Wall Street speculation.""
In this fact-check, we look at whether the federal government provided trillions of dollars of zero interest rate loans.
Sanders is not fully accurate. Most of the loans –– and there were different types –– came at rates that were quite low, but above zero. 
The total reaches $2 trillion, but not all of it went to the big players on Wall Street.
The bailout money
In 2008, a financial house of cards built on junk home mortgages collapsed. With warnings that $5 trillion in U.S. assets could be wiped out virtually overnight, Washington moved to stem the crisis.
The Federal Reserve was the biggest player, especially in terms of loans to the Wall Street banks. Congressional action was hefty, in the hundreds of billions, but much smaller compared to the Fed. 
The Sanders campaign highlighted the work of the Fed, citing news reports of trillions of dollars in aid.
""One program alone doled out nearly $9 trillion,"" said the Christian Science Monitor. 
But many of the loans involved banks rolling over short-term loans from one period to the next. Economics professor Todd Keister at Rutgers University said this produced a lot of double counting. He used the example of a home mortgage to explain what was going on.
""Suppose I borrow $100,000 to buy a house and then later refinance,"" Keister said. ""The refinancing involves paying off the original loan and taking a new loan for $100,000. If we add up the loans I took, we would say that I borrowed a total of $200,000. But there is a clear sense in which the amount I borrowed to buy the house was always $100,000.""
The actual amount was about $1.4 trillion.

That’s not trillions, as Sanders said, but it’s getting close.
Federal Reserve data shows that interest rates were very low, but not at zero.

""Those interest rates were subsidized,"" said University of Louisiana finance professor Linus Wilson. ""Nevertheless, the interest rates were not zero.""
Sanders took liberties in suggesting all the benefits went to Wall Street, though it’s fair to say the big banks did well. In some cases, outside the Fed, they got billions of dollars outright and through a number of federal actions, the biggest banks grew bigger.
But many regional and community banks also benefited. About two-thirds of the loans in the largest program — the Term Auction Facility — came through Federal Reserve banks outside of New York.
Another $1.1 trillion in play
Among its other programs, the Fed was also buying bundles of home mortgages that the biggest banks had on their books. By June 2010, the Fed’s Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities program peaked at $1.1 trillion. 
This was not a loan, but it helped the banks’ balance sheets, and freed up money for more home mortgages and other lending.
Not every expert would count it as aid to the banks, but if you do, it would bring the total aid to $2.5 trillion. 
The TARP factor
Outside of the Fed, Congress authorized direct government bailouts, in the form of the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the government takeover of the government-chartered home mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
According to a running tally by the nonprofit investigative journalism group ProPublica, the federal outlays were $633 billion. While Wall Street banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs pocketed $135 billion, the money went to many places other than Wall Street banks, such as General Motors.
Adding all of it though to the Fed’s activities gives us two totals: either about $2 trillion if we don’t count the mortgage security purchases, or about $3.1 trillion if we do.
Sanders said Congress gave Wall Street free money. The focus on Congress is a bit off, because while Wall Street did get billions, to get to trillions, the Fed dollars are essential. And the Fed operated on its own.
""Congress delegates responsibility to the Fed,"" said Rutgers economist Eugene White.
Our ruling
Sanders said that during the Great Recession, Congress gave Wall Street ""trillions of dollars of zero interest loans.""
By our calculations, the total across several actions ranged from $2 trillion to about $3.1 trillion.
But Sanders is less accurate regarding where the money went and the interest rate. The biggest Wall Street players benefited greatly, but banks and other business across the country also got help. And while very low, the interest rates remained above zero. Also, the Fed is not Congress.
Sanders oversimplified a complex response to an economic crisis. We rate this claim Half True."

Not much | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Some Facebook users are implicating Chick-fil-A in a Ugandan bill that would impose the death penalty for gay sex.
""Today Uganda announced a bill to legalize murdering gay people,"" reads one popular post, which was published Oct. 14. ""National Christian Organization paid a preacher to go to Uganda and help their lawmakers with the bill. Chick-fil-a (sic) funds National Christian Org.""
""If you eat at Chick-fil-a, this is what your money goes to.""
The post, which is a screenshot of a tweet, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post refers to a bill in Uganda, where homosexuality is already illegal, that would punish gay sex with death. The bill was nullified five years ago on a technicality, but lawmakers have announced plans to revive it.
In essence, the post is claiming that Chick-fil-A’s charitable contributions have been used to promote the death penalty for gay people in Uganda. Similar claims about the fried chicken chain and the Uganda bill have been shared thousands of times, so we wanted to check it out.
Here’s what we found:
• The nonprofit the Facebook post is referencing is the National Christian Foundation.
• The preacher mentioned in the post did travel to Uganda around the time lawmakers were debating an anti-LGBTQ bill, but there’s no evidence he helped craft it.
• The foundation run by Chick-fil-A’s owners has donated to the National Christian Foundation in the past, but it doesn’t currently.
Evangelist traveled to Uganda with foundation money
An American evangelical preacher supported by the National Christian Foundation did travel to Uganda in 2010, the same year the country was debating an anti-LGBTQ bill. But Colorado-based preacher Lou Engle didn’t ""help their lawmakers with the bill,"" as the Facebook post claims.
Let’s focus first on what Engle did or didn’t do while in Uganda.
Engle is the co-founder of TheCall Ministries, a defunct evangelical Christian group known for anti-LGBTQ views. It aimed to start ""a John the Baptist type movement to fast and pray in preparation for a 3rd great awakening.""
In 2010, Engle traveled to Kampala, Uganda, to be the guest of honor at a Sunday prayer and rally about ""homosexuality, witchcraft, corruption and the fear of violence leading up to the country’s presidential election next year,"" the New York Times reported.

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni signs a new anti-gay bill that sets harsh penalties for homosexual sex, in Entebbe, Uganda Monday, Feb. 24, 2014. (AP)
At the time, Ugandan lawmakers were debating a bill that broadened the criminalization of homosexuality and imposed the death penalty. A different version of the bill, which imposed life sentences instead of the death penalty, was signed into law in 2014, resulting in sanctions from the United States and other countries. A court annulled it later that year due to a legislative technicality.
Engle was not directly linked to the legislation in Uganda, and he issued a statement ahead of his rally condemning the bill’s harsh penalties for homosexuality. However, during his rally in Kampala, Engle did praise the country’s ""courage"" and ""righteousness"" in pursuing the bill, the Times reported.
What is the National Christian Foundation?
The National Christian Foundation is a Georgia-based religious nonprofit and one of the largest charities in the United States. It was founded in 1982 by tax attorney Terry Parker, financial adviser Ron Blue and evangelical Christian author Larry Burkett.
The National Christian Foundation gave TheCall $500 in 2009 and $300 in 2010, according to the group’s public tax documents. In 2008, TheCall received a much larger donation from the foundation — more than $160,000.
It’s unclear to what extent those donations were explicitly for traveling to Uganda, if at all. TheCall announced it was closing sometime in 2018, according to the Wayback Machine.
A 2012 investigation from the Atlantic found that, in 2008, the National Christian Foundation gave money to Ed Silvoso, a minister who founded a fundamentalist group called Harvest Evangelism, to work with a Ugandan bishop advocating for legislation imposing the death penalty for gay sex.
The Chick-fil-A connection
Chick-fil-A did not support Uganda’s anti-gay bill, and connecting the company to it requires several steps.
Most of the company and its owners’ charitable giving is conducted through two nonprofit foundations: the Chick-fil-A Foundation and the WinShape Foundation. The former was created by the company in 2012 and the latter was founded by the Cathy family 1984.
Public tax records show the Chick-fil-A Foundation has not contributed money to the National Christian Foundation. However, the reverse is true — the National Christian Foundation gave the Chick-fil-A Foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2014 and 2015.
The WinShape Foundation’s tax records paint a different picture.
We analyzed the foundation’s returns dating back to 2009, when the National Christian Foundation was donating to Engle’s TheCall. We found that WinShape’s contributions to the National Christian Foundation totaled $240,000 in 2009 and $247,500 in both 2010 and 2011. The National Christian Foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to WinShape over the past decade.

We asked Chick-fil-A and the WinShape Foundation why they passed money back and forth over the years. WinShape didn’t respond, and the company didn’t comment on the tax returns.
""The WinShape Foundation is a private family organization. The Chick-fil-A Foundation is the official philanthropic arm of Chick-fil-A, Inc.,"" the spokesperson said. ""Chick-fil-A has not supported legislative campaigns of any kind in Uganda.""
The National Christian Foundation has a track record of donating to anti-LGBTQ groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. The former has supported sterilizing transgender people while the latter has defended the discredited practice of conversion therapy.
In 2012, following comments from Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy opposing same-sex marriage, Chick-fil-A said it would ""leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena."" But 2017 tax documents from the company and its owners’ foundations show it still donates to organizations with negative views of homosexuality, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Paul Anderson Youth Home.
Our ruling
A Facebook post of a tweet claimed that Chick-fil-A has contributed to the National Christian Foundation, which then funded a preacher to travel to Uganda to help lawmakers craft an anti-gay bill.
News reports show that the evangelical preacher Lou Engle did travel to Uganda in 2010, around the time that lawmakers were crafting a bill that would have imposed the death penalty for gay sex. However, Engle did not directly contribute to the legislation. While he complimented Ugandans for their stance against homosexuality, he denounced the harsh penalties proposed in the bill.
Federal tax returns show that the National Christian Foundation contributed to Engle’s evangelical Christian group in 2009, before his trip. Documents also show that the WinShape Foundation, which is run by Chick-fil-A’s owners, donated to the National Christian Foundation in 2009, but the link between the company and Uganda’s anti-gay legislation is weak.

That's Pants on Fire,"Amid the pressure of a House impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump has continued to stoke the idea that he’s the victim of a coup — shorthand for ""coup d’etat,"" a French term that means the overthrow of the government.
""As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the........People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!"", Trump tweeted on Oct. 1. 
The following day, Trump’s campaign unveiled a new ad that said, ""It’s nothing short of a coup, and it must be stopped.""
On several subsequent occasions he’s shared his allies’ uses of the word on Twitter. He retweeted ""coup"" comments by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, on Oct. 3; former House speaker Newt Gingrich on Oct. 10; conservative broadcaster Mark Levin on Oct. 14; Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on Oct. 19; and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., on Oct. 24. Earlier in the year, Trump referred to the special counsel report headed by Robert Mueller as a coup.
However, his use of the word ""coup"" to describe impeachment, a constitutionally defined process, is not accurate, even as a figure of speech.
What is a coup?
Let’s start with a more literal definition. The key element of a coup is that it is carried out beyond the bounds of legality.
""We define a coup d'état as the sudden and irregular (i.e., illegal or extra-legal) removal, or displacement, of the executive authority of an independent government,"" wrote the Coup D’etat Project at the University of Illinois’ Cline Center for Democracy in 2013.
Violence is part of many coups, but being violent is not a necessary condition.
Of the 12 types of coups recognized by the Cline Center, nine do not seem to have anything to do with what Trump is talking about, including military coups, rebel coups, popular revolts, dissident actions, palace coups, foreign coups, internationally mediated transitions, forced resignations, and self-coups, in which the leader strong-arms other branches of government to entrench power.
Two other types are defined by how far they got — attempted coups (which try and fail) and coup conspiracies (which never get to the stage of being carried out). Any supposed coup against Trump would have been a coup attempt, since he’s still in office. But that doesn’t mean there actually was a coup attempt.
Is impeachment equivalent to a coup?
Impeachment is explicitly described in the Constitution as the way to remove a president who has committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" 
Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor, told us that you can’t get much more within the bounds of legality than an explicit power outlined in the Constitution.
""It’s obviously not a coup for the House to launch impeachment proceedings,"" Klarman told us in early October.
The lead author of the Cline Center report, University of Illinois political scientist Peter F. Nardulli, called Trump’s usage ""ill-informed.""
""What is going on today in the United States is a constitutionally sanctioned process that is an integral part of the checks and balances that have been vital to the longevity and success of the U.S. Constitution and the Republic it created,"" he told PolitiFact.
He added that ""there is nothing sudden or decisive about what is going on in the House of Representatives. It is conducting a deliberative, constitutionally sanctioned process. If an impeachment resolution is adopted, it will simply be forwarded to the Senate to conduct a trial.""
Also, if Trump is removed from office, his duly elected vice president, Mike Pence, would take over -- not the opposition party.
The Trump camp’s defense
The Trump campaign defended the president’s comments by saying that dictionary definitions allow usages that are more informal than the ones used by academics such as the Cline Center. Merriam-Webster, for instance, says the word can mean ""a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics.""
The Trump campaign pointed to widespread examples of Democratic lawmakers using ""coup"" to describe the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and to media reports using the word to characterize a 2009 change in leadership in the New York state legislature.
Experts largely acknowledged that the word has more informal uses, and they retroactively admonished Democrats for using such language during Clinton’s impeachment.
However, they said Trump is wrong — and ill-advised — to regularly encourage the use of the word ""coup"" to describe impeachment.
While hyperbolic rhetoric is common in politics, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, ""what is unusual with Trump’s use of the term ‘coup’ is that it is the president who is using the term.""
""President Trump is taking the lead in intensifying the rhetorical battle, which is bound to make the divide between his supporters and other Americans even deeper than it would be if legislators and pundits were using the term,"" Smith said. Such an approach ""will justify more radical strategies in the future.""
Nardulli of the University of Illinois added that ""there are good reasons that, like facts, people are not entitled to choose their own definitions of important things such as coups, especially when those definitions are self-serving.""
In fact, Trump’s use of a word with such shock value is not an isolated incident, said Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College. It needs to be understood as part of a larger strategy, he said.
Trump has quoted pastor Robert Jeffress ""as saying impeachment would lead to ‘civil war,’ he has asked whether Adam Schiff should be arrested for treason, and he has suggested that the whistleblower was engaged in espionage against the U.S. government,"" Pitney said. ""This is all serious stuff for someone who gives orders to the military and the attorney general.""
(We previously rated Trump’s use of ""treason"" Pants on Fire.)
In addition to weakening constitutional directives at home, the use of ""coup"" sends a signal to anti-democratic forces overseas, said Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University.
""At a time when the rule of law is under threat in both the United States and throughout the world, I think it is important to differentiate the legitimate impeachment process from illegal attempts to overthrow a government,"" Arend said. ""People may differ on whether they believe there is sufficient evidence to merit impeachment or removal from office, but the use of the impeachment process as established in the Constitution does not constitute a ‘coup.’'
Our ruling
Trump has used the term ""coup"" to describe the impeachment process, and has approvingly retweeted allies who have used it.
Trump’s campaign said the word can be applied more informally than as an extra-legal ouster of a government. However, Trump’s repeated use of the term alongside such other inflammatory charges such as ""treason"" suggests that he is using it intentionally to call into question the legitimacy of a constitutionally prescribed process.
His statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire."
1,"""Barack Obama put a permanent stop on this military aid to the Ukraine - he never allowed it to go.""","on Friday, October 25th, 2019",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/oct/25/matt-gaetz/matt-gaetz-says-obama-permanently-stopped-military/,Mostly False,Matt Gaetz,Matt Gaetz misleads about Obama's record on Ukraine military aid | PolitiFact Florid,"U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has become one of President Donald Trump’s key attack dogs as he pushes back against the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry through protests, regular Fox News appearances and on Twitter.
As part of his defense of Trump, the second-term north Florida congressman has pointed the finger at former President Barack Obama’s actions related to Ukraine. 
""Barack Obama put a permanent stop on this military aid to the Ukraine - he never allowed it to go,"" Gaetz tweeted Oct. 21. ""You’re telling me Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for delivering aid that Obama didn’t deliver? That’s ludicrous."" Gaetz made similar remarks in a Fox News interview with Jeanine Pirro.
In both instances, Gaetz oversimplified the facts and didn’t tell the full story. 
The Obama administration refused to provide lethal weapons in 2014. The decision came as Russian forces invaded the eastern territory of Crimea in 2014 after Ukraine ousted its pro-Russia president. But the United States under Obama did provide extensive military and security aid but not lethal weapons.
Further, Gaetz misrepresented the focus of the impeachment inquiry, which is about whether Trump temporarily withheld aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden. 
Obama’s record on military aid
When Gaetz said ""this aid,"" his spokesman said, Gaetz wasn’t talking about all military aid. He was referring to specific lethal military assistance that has been recounted in news reports in recent weeks.
Gaetz’s office cited a recent column by conservative writer Marc Thiessen in the New York Post. The column mentions a sentence of reporting in a 2014 Wall Street Journal article about Obama rejecting ""weapons or lethal military aid to Ukraine."" 
At the time, Obama officials were debating whether to send lethal military equipment amid the conflict with Russia, particularly Javelin anti-tank missiles. Obama rejected a request from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for lethal aid in 2014, though the White House approved a $53 million aid package that included vehicles, patrol boats, body armor and night-vision goggles, as well as humanitarian assistance.
U.S. officials were concerned that providing the Javelins to Ukraine would escalate their conflict with Russia. Key allies, including Germany, were not keen on sending weapons into the conflict zone, said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia and senior research scientist at the CNA Corporation.
Between 2014 and 2016, the United States committed more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine.
Under Obama, the federal government started the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which sent other kinds of U.S. military equipment to the country. From 2016 to 2019, Congress appropriated $850 million.
In the last year of the Obama administration, Congress authorized lethal aid, but it didn’t include the Javelins.
The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law in November 2015, called for ""lethal assistance such as anti-armor weapon systems, mortars, crew-served weapons and ammunition, grenade launchers and ammunition, and small arms and ammunition.""
The legislation also called for counter-artillery radars, unmanned aerial tactical surveillance systems and other equipment.
But experts told us that the equipment ultimately provided during Obama’s tenure was non-lethal aid.
""The first lethal deliveries came from Trump,"" said Jim Townsend, deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO Policy during the Obama administration. 
Trump, in his meeting Sept. 30 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York, would later downplay the money Obama gave calling it ""pillows and sheets."" (Former president Poroshenko had used similar language in 2014, telling Congress, ""Blankets and night vision goggles are important, but one cannot win a war with a blanket."")
""It’s not as if the White House was putting together these lists from political science majors sitting behind desks,"" Townsend said. ""They were recommended by European command and others who went in to see what they needed.""
In July 2016, the White House announced a $335 million security assistance package for Ukraine that included ""counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, secure communications, training aids, logistics infrastructure and IT systems, tactical UAVs, and medical equipment.""
In 2017, the Trump administration said it would sell lethal aid to Ukraine, and in 2018 it approved a plan to sell Ukraine $47 million in lethal Javelin Missiles. Even though the Trump administration has allowed the weapons, they are far from the frontlines.
Congress approved another $250 million in military assistance in 2018, which Trump temporarily withheld along with $141 million in State Department aid in July.
RELATED: The U.S. aid to Ukraine that Donald Trump froze, in one chart
A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that the United States has provided $1.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014.
To set the record straight, Democrats didn’t launch an impeachment inquiry because Trump delivered the lethal aid. 
Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power by withholding the aid while asking its government to look into Biden, his potential 2020 opponent. They have not yet formulated articles of impeachment. 
Our ruling
Gaetz said, ""Barack Obama put a permanent stop on this military aid to the Ukraine - he never allowed it to go.""
Obama did not permanently stop military aid to Ukraine.
The element of truth in Gaetz's statement is the Obama administration did not provide lethal military aid that Ukraine asked for in 2014. However, it did provide other military equipment and training. The United States has provided $1.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, on average $300 million a year.

We reached out to CNN about the post and Liza Pluto, a spokesperson for Baldwin’s show, told us it’s not accurate. 
""This is not true and Brooke did not say that,"" she said. 
Searching Nexis for news coverage of that quote, we found no results. 
We did find stories from 2015 about an apology from Baldwin over comments she made about veterans — just not what appears in this Facebook post. 
On April 28, 2015, Baldwin interviewed the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., on camera amid protests and violence in Baltimore in the wake of Freddie Gray’s death in police custody. Speaking about police training, she said: ""I was talking to a city councilman here last week who was saying, ‘Brooke, these people have to live in the communities. There’s no emotional, or there’s a lack of emotional investment,’ and a lot of these young people … and I love our nation’s veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don’t know the communities and they’re ready to do battle."" 
She was quickly criticized, garnering headlines like this one from Breitbart: ""CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin blames military veterans for Baltimore riots.""
As the Washington Post’s media critic documented, she tweeted that same day: ""Folks. Please don’t misunderstand me. Dear friends/family of mine are veterans. I was repeating a concern vocalized to me lately. That’s it."" 
The next morning, though, she went on air to apologize. 
""I made a mistake yesterday,"" she said. I was recounting a story, a conversation I had had recently just referring to police. And I absolutely misspoke, I inartfully chose my words 100% and I just wish speaking to all of you this morning: I wholeheartedly retract what I said.""
Later on air she said she ""gave credence to the idea that veterans returning from war who were police officers were furthering the problems in communities like these here in Baltimore and nationwide. And I just have to take a moment again today and say I was wrong. I was so wrong."" 
Our ruling
The Facebook post claims Baldwin said: ""Don’t hire veterans! They’re too damaged to be trusted with authority.""
We didn’t find any credible evidence that she said that. The statement appears to be an interpretation of comments she made involving veterans during an interview, but it goes too far by presenting incendiary words as if Baldwin herself said them.

The list consists of maiden names, middle names, relatives names and nicknames. 
Let’s take this person by person.
President Obama - Post says his real name is ""Barry Soetoro.""
As stated in his birth certificate, President Barack Obama’s real, full name is Barack Hussein Obama, II.
We previously fact-checked where the names Barry Soetoro and Barack Hussein Obama intersect.
""Barry"" was a childhood nickname for ""Barack."" He went by Soetoro, the last name of his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, when he was young and growing up in Indonesia. At the age of 10, Obama moved back to his birthplace of Hawaii and stopped using the last name. 
Kamala Harris - Post says her real name is ""Maya Harrison.""
This is wrong. California Sen. Kamala Harris was named Kamala Devi Harris when she was born on Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, Calif. She has a younger sister named Maya Harris.
Ilhan Omar - Post says her real name is ""Ilhan Esmi.""
No. U.S. Rep. Ihan Omar’s ""real"" name is Ilhan Abdullahi Omar. The Minnesota congresswoman married, and divorced, a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. (Not Elsi, as the post spells it).
Bill de Blasio - Post says his real name is ""Warren Wilhelm Jr.""
Bill de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. on May 8, 1961, in Manhattan. But in 1983, he petitioned a New York court to change his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm because he said his father was largely absent and he wanted to embrace his mother’s Italian heritage. He formally adopted the name Bill de Blasio in January 2002. 
Elizabeth Warren - Post says her real name is ""Liz Herring.""
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s real name is Elizabeth Warren. She was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City to parents Donald and Pauline Herring. ""Liz,"" of course, is a common shortened nickname for the name Elizabeth. (Her childhood nickname, Betsy, is what her mother called her.)
She kept the last name Warren after she and her first husband, Jim Warren, divorced in 1980.
Pete Buttigieg - Post says his real name is ""Peter Montgomery.""
This is weird cherry-picking. The South Bend, Ind., mayor’s full name is Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg (not ""Buttigeig"" as the post spells it). He is the only child to Joseph Buttigieg and Jennifer Anne Montgomery Buttigieg. 
Bernie Sanders - Post says his real name is ""Bernard Gutman.""
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ real name is Bernard Sanders. His parents were Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders and Dorothy Glassberg. The misconception that the senator’s surname is actually Gutman appears to come from a 1921 U.S. immigration record when his father arrived from Poland. The record lists Sanders’ father as Eliasz Gitman, though he was naturalized under Elias Sanders. The recording lists Bernie Sanders’ grandmother as Jetti Gutman, which was her married name.
Our ruling
A viral Facebook post claims a list of prominent Democratic politicians are concealing their true identities from the public and shares what it says are their ""real names.""
The names the candidates are accused of faking are, in fact, their legal names. The Facebook post pulls pulls their maiden names, married surnames, nicknames, middle names and in one case a sibling’s name to make the candidates seem nefarious.

Jessica Carlson, a spokesperson for Target, told us that the company doesn’t carry the book. 
Searching online, we found general complaints about Target selling the book and some criticizing the store for selling it to children. But we found no evidence that Target or Barnes & Noble is marketing this book for children or selling it in the children’s section.

That case is still pending | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York. But a Facebook post takes it further by claiming that the family has already been ""disallowed."" That hasn’t happened.
""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity,"" said the Oct. 8 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 43,000 times.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
In June 2018, the New York Attorney General (then Barbara Underwood) filed a lawsuit against Trump and three of his adult children — Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump — and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three eldest children were on the board of directors.
""This pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law,"" the lawsuit said.
As a result, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service in New York not-for-profit or charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit wants to ban Trump’s involvement for ten years and the three Trump children for one year. The Trump children’s ban would be subject to suspension if they undergo training on related fiduciary duties.
The Donald J. Trump Foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve. But the legal case is still ongoing. A spokesperson for the Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James said the office could not comment on the pending case.
The Facebook post includes a picture of Trump and his son, Eric, posing for what appears to have been an event for the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. St. Jude treats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The Eric Trump Foundation raised money for St. Jude. 
Eric Trump’s foundation has also come under scrutiny, but the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps’ involvement in New York charities is not tied to the Eric Trump Foundation.
Forbes has reported that Eric Trump’s foundation gave donors the impression that all funds it raised at an annual golf event went to St. Jude, yet more than $500,000 went to other causes; and that at least four groups that received donations from Eric Trump’s foundation later paid for golf tournaments at Trump-owned courses.
Eric Trump in December 2016 resigned from his own foundation, and the foundation restructured and rebranded itself as Curetivity.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said, ""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity.""
A lawsuit does seek to temporarily ban Donald Trump and his three eldest children from being part of charities in New York. But that case is still pending. 
The lawsuit relates to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, not to a kids cancer charity. The lawsuit alleges that Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations of entities he controlled, to promote his hotels, to buy personal items, and to support his presidential election campaign.
Trump’s son, Eric, led a foundation that raised money for kids with cancer, and that foundation has come under scrutiny over its own handling of funds. But the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps from participating in charities isn’t pegged to Eric Trump’s foundation.

1,"""I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general"" election.","on Thursday, October 24th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/24/andrew-yang/andrew-yangs-claim-support-among-trump-voters-rate/,Pants on Fire!,Andrew Yang,Andrew Yang's claim of support among Trump voters rates Pants on Fire,"Democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang has regularly touted his cross-partisan appeal, and he usually cites a particular data point to make that case.
""I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general,"" Yang said in a sit-down with the Washington Post on Oct. 22. Earlier, he said something similar to CBS News and in a tweet.
A reader asked us to check whether this was true, so we took a closer look.
When we checked with Yang’s campaign, they pointed to a survey by the Economist and YouGov conducted from July 21-23. The survey asked voters whether they planned to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus; if they said yes, they were asked who they would vote for.
Out of 1,500 total adult respondents, 460 said they were planning to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. Separately, poll respondents had been asked who they voted for in 2016, Trump or Hillary Clinton. Of those 460, 41 said they had voted for Trump in 2016.
Of those 41 voters, 10% said they would support Yang, ranking him second to Bernie Sanders at 14%. Other candidates close to double digits were Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Julian Castro at 8%, while 12% said they weren’t sure.
This tracks with what Yang said. But coming from the guy who says he wants to ""Make America Think Harder,"" Yang needs a course in how polling works.
Economist/YouGov polls since July 
The Economist/YouGov poll has asked the same question every week since the July 21-23 survey Yang cited. The later polls squash any notion that Yang has high support among Trump voters. 
Here’s a rundown of every Economist-YouGov poll with enough responses since late July, showing Yang’s percentage among past Trump voters compared to other top finishers. We located these in the fivethirtyeight.com polling archive.
Of the 11 subsequent polls, Yang only matched or exceeded 10% twice. More often, Yang’s share of the Trump vote was much lower than that. In the most recent poll, Yang’s share of the Trump voter support was zero.
In fact, the July poll Yang cites is the only time Yang finished in the top two among Democrats. 
And while Yang says he was only one of two candidates to surpass 10%, if you look across all of the polls, eight candidates actually achieved that — Yang, Biden, Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, Michael Bennet and Steve Bullock.
The full breakdown of the polls is attached at the bottom of this fact-check.
The statistic means little anyway
Ignoring all of the above (even though you shouldn’t), polling experts say the figure Yang cites is meaningless, because of the small sample of participants surveyed.
In most of the Economist/YouGov polls, roughly 30-40 people said they voted for Trump in 2016 but would be voting in a Democratic primary or caucus in 2020. Ten percent of that (which is near Yang’s high water mark) would represent three to four people.
Steve Smith, a Washington University political scientist who runs his own online panel survey, said that corresponds to a standard margin of error of about plus or minus 15 percentage points. That renders the question useless to anyone who cares about statistics, polling or math.
When we checked with Joe Williams, the YouGov director of polling, he said he agreed with our overall analysis of Yang’s assertion. 
When we contacted the Yang campaign, they said they stood by their talking point.
Our ruling
Yang said, ""I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general"" election.
This claim comes from one poll in July that sampled 41 Trump voters who said they planned to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. The question has been asked by the same pollster weekly since July, and those results have never been replicated.
Even if they had, the margin of error for a sample size that small is about 15 percentage points, rendering them essentially meaningless.
The math isn’t hard on this one. We rate Yang’s claim Pants on Fire.

The post features text around a collage of popular food and drink items such as Pepsi, Doritos, Lays, Fritos, Aunt Jemima and Gatorade. It says:
""If only sheeple knew .. that there’s a flavor enhancement company called senomyx that puts aborted baby fetus cells in their food and drinks.""
The post also has a lengthy caption that appears to be taken entirely from a 2015 blog post by Rich Swier, in which Swier includes this excerpt from a Conservative Post story: 
""Kraft, PepsiCo, Nestle, work with Semonyx, a California-based [company] that uses aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals. The aborted human fetal cell line is known as ‘HEK-293,’ and it is used to see how the human palate will react to synthetic flavors. Since most of today’s processed food lacks flavor, companies like Semonyx are hired to develop flavors on their own...""
Swier, according to the blog, holds a doctorate of education from the University of Southern California.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Let’s just start off by saying that no —neither Kraft nor Pepsi nor any other U.S. food company is selling items to the public that contain ""aborted baby fetus cells.""
The Conservative Post story that Swier’s blog and the Facebook post reference no longer exists on the website, but we traced the controversial claim back to a 2011 dispute involving Senomyx, a San Diego-based biotechnology company, and a pro-life group called Children of God for Life. 
According to an archived version of a March 29, 2011, press release from Children of God for Life, the group called for a boycott of food companies that contract with Senomyx. The organization pointed to an April 2002 report by Senomyx researchers as proof that the company was adding HEK 293 — Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells — in its research and development to enhance flavor.
HEK 293 is a line of cells originally derived from human embryo kidney cells and that were grown in a tissue culture. The first source of the cells was a fetus that was legally aborted in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The cell line has been widely used in biological and medical inquiry, especially for cancer research.
Fetal stem cell research has been used in cell biology for over 30 years. But no company is manufacturing food or other products intended for human consumption that contain aborted human fetuses. 
Senomyx has used the HEK 293 cell line in its flavor research to function as the mouth’s taste receptor cells, allowing the company to test hundreds of substances. But these cells are not in any of the actual food products that consumers would find on the market. CBS News wrote about this in 2011: 
""To non-scientists this may sound a bit strange, but the reality is that HEK 293 cells are widely used in pharmaceutical research, helping scientists create vaccines as well as drugs like those for rheumatoid arthritis. The difference here is that Senomyx's work for Pepsi is one of the first times the cells have (potentially) been used to create a food or beverage. (And it's important to note that no part of a human kidney cell are ever a part of Senomyx's taste enhancers or any finished food products.)""
Gwen Rosenberg, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications for Senomyx, described the process to the Miami New Times during the 2011 controversy and said the process is ""basically a robotic tasting system"":
""(Rosenberg) depicted rows of little plastic square dishes with hundreds of tiny indentations in each dish. A protein is placed in each indentation, then a flavor. If the protein reacts to the flavor, the results are charted. If the new flavor (of which the company has more than 800,000) is successful with the protein test, the company then conducts taste tests with (live) adult humans.""
Science and medicine writer Matthew Herper also broke down the process in a 2012 Forbes article:
""This is 35-year-old technology. And it is widely used in cell biology. And there is no way you'll consume them or that the cells would cause any health problems.
""... The kidney cells were forced to take up bits of DNA using a technique invented in 1973 that used a calcium solution. The resulting cells don't act much like human cells at all, but they are very easy to work with and have become workhorses of cellular biology. That's why they're used in the development of drugs and vaccines. (Here's the original paper on the creation of the HEK cells.) No new fetal tissue has been used to keep the cell culture going; the use of this cell line isn't leading to new abortion.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims several popular food companies add ""aborted baby fetus cells in their food and drinks"" for flavor enhancement.
The post mischaracterizes the use fetal stem cell research by biotechnology companies such as Senomyx. HEK 293 cells, a cell line from an aborted fetus from the 1970s, has been widely used in cell biology research for over 30 years in multiple areas, including food and pharmaceutical development. But none of these cells are found in the food products available to consumers.
So, while there is a back-story associated with this post, the claim itself is too inaccurate to rate it anything but False."
1,"""The vast majority of Wisconsin students cannot even read, write, or do math at grade level.""","on Wednesday, October 23rd, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/23/jeremy-thiesfeldt/no-vast-majority-wisconsin-students-are-not-below-/,False,Jeremy Thiesfeldt,"No, the “vast majority” of Wisconsin students are not below grade level | PolitiFact Wisconsin","Are the vast majority of Wisconsin students failing to achieve at grade level?
That was the claim made in a recent radio address by state Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt.
The Fond du Lac Republican — a former teacher and principal — chairs the state Assembly Committee on Education. That makes him a key player in any school-related changes the Republican-controlled Legislature brings before Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.
In the Republicans’ statewide weekly radio address on Sept. 19, 2019, Thiesfeldt said Wisconsin has to ""do better"" on education, especially given the amount of money the state spent there in the eight years of Republican control under former Gov. Scott Walker.
Then he said this:
""The vast majority of Wisconsin students cannot even read, write, or do math at grade level.""
That’s an alarming stat if true.
Assessing his claim takes us deep into state and national testing thresholds and some shifting definitions.
Let’s get started.
Claim built on latest test scores
As proof, Thiesfeldt’s staff pointed to the most recent Wisconsin Student Assessment System results. The annual tests include the Forward Exam for grades three to eight and ACT-related tests for grades nine to 11.
In the 2018-19 tests, 39.3% of students were rated as proficient or advanced in English Language Arts, and 40.1% reached those levels for math, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
For starters, calling 60% the ""vast majority"" is overstating things quite a bit. 
But let’s focus on the ""grade level"" part of Thiesfeldt’s claim. Is it reasonable to say anyone below proficient is also below grade level?
That’s a very complicated question.
DPI breaks the assessment scores into four categories of student achievement: advanced, proficient, basic and below basic. We’ll focus on the middle two since that’s where this claim is centered.
Proficient – Student demonstrates adequate understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness.
Basic – Student demonstrates partial understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness.
Katie Scott, a policy adviser in Thiesfeldt’s office, highlighted the ""adequate understanding"" element of the proficient definition.
""For an exam taken in the final months of the school year, we are confident that parents, teachers, etc. would not prefer the achievement of students at grade level to be described as a ‘partial understanding,’"" she said in an email.
Scott also asserted that proficient ""has always meant at or above grade level.""
Definitions a moving target
So Thiesfeldt’s argument is that proficiency = grade level.
But both sides of that equation are moving targets.
The term grade level is used at times to refer to how students perform relative to a standard set by officials, which is how Thiesfeldt uses it. But it can also refer to what students typically learn in a grade, in other words the median test score for that age level across the state.
We’ll stick to the idea that grade level is some kind of threshold. But it’s tricky equating it to proficiency since the definition of proficient has changed over time in Wisconsin.
In the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk, a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
But that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the ""proficient"" threshold. The state was aligning its standards to match the National Assessment of Educational Progress — also called the Nation’s Report Card.
In other words, proficient no longer means what it once did in Wisconsin. Can it still be equated to grade level as Thiesfeldt does?
""The answer is quite emphatically no,"" Borsuk said.
He elaborated in his Sept. 13, 2019, Journal Sentinel column.
""I’m increasingly willing to lump ‘basic’ with ‘proficient’ and ‘advanced’ to get a rough measure of whether kids are on grade level,"" Borsuk wrote. ""And if you do that, you come up with — to give one example — about three-quarters for Wisconsin public school students in third through eighth grade rated as basic or better in English language arts (often just called reading), which certainly looks better than saying well below half are proficient.""
Tom Loveless, a former senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who authored the group’s annual report on education trends for 16 years, said he agreed with Borsuk that a basic rating on the state’s assessment system tests is roughly equal to what the proficient rating was years ago.
But there’s still more evidence to consider.
National test warns against equating proficient with ""grade level""
A Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction spokesman didn’t take a position on proficient vs. grade level beyond the definitions cited above.
But the go-to source for national testing sheds some light on the matter.
The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a congressionally authorized project of the U.S. Department of Education that measures student achievement in select subjects across the nation.
Remember, Wisconsin made changes to its scale get in sync with NAEP. An August 2019 study by the NAEP found the state was quite successful in doing so. The analysis scored each state from 0 to 500 in two subjects at two grade levels to show how high the bar was to achieve proficiency. That could then be compared to other states and the national scale used by NAEP.
For grade four math, the state and national standards were exactly the same at 249.  For grade four reading, the score for NAEP proficiency was 238, while Wisconsin’s was 229.
The eighth-grade scores were also very close, with the state and national threshold separated by two points for reading and four points for math.
And here’s what the NAEP has to say about conflating proficiency with grade level:
Myth: The NAEP Proficient level is like being on grade level.
Fact: NAEP Proficient means competency over challenging subject matter. This is not the same as being ""on grade level,"" which refers to performance on local curriculum and standards. NAEP is a general assessment of knowledge and skills in a particular subject.
""NAEP proficient means mastery over challenging subject matter,"" said NAEP spokesman Grady Wilburn. ""We don’t use any terms in NAEP to equate achievement level to what may be grade level in a state. … The achievement level proficient, for example, is aspirational. We don’t define that as something necessary to proceed from one grade to the next.""
So the Wisconsin proficiency standard is largely in line with the national standard, and the people behind the national standard warn it should not be conflated with ""grade level."" 
Therefore, Wisconsin should be similarly careful, Loveless said.
""Wisconsin set its cut point at the NAEP proficiency level on purpose,"" he said. ""So it should carry with it all the warnings that go with the NAEP proficient cut point.""
For the record, Wisconsin students ranked about average in the latest NAEP data. In 2017, 40% of students nationwide tested at or above the proficient level using the NAEP standard. Wisconsin came in at 42%.
The NAEP study also showed Wisconsin has one of the highest bars for proficiency in the nation. The grade eight ratings were third- and fourth-highest among the states in the study, and grade four ratings came in 10th and 18th.
Our ruling
Thiesfeldt used state test results to claim the ""vast majority"" of Wisconsin students are below grade level in math and English.
Experts say proficient was once roughly equal to some definitions of grade level, but a dramatic shift in 2013 means that is no longer the case. Wisconsin raised the bar and — predictably — more kids then failed to clear it.
Today, Wisconsin’s definition of proficient is almost identical to that of a key federal testing agency that explicitly warns against conflating proficiency with grade level. They say proficiency is more akin to ""mastery"" of a subject.
We rate Thiesfeldt’s claim False."
1,"""Most of the requests for records possessed by the Attorney General’s Office are from private law firms and companies.""","on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/vermont/statements/2019/oct/22/tj-donovan/vermonts-ag-misses-mark-claim-most-records-request/,Mostly False,TJ Donovan,Vermont's AG misses mark with claim that 'most' records requests come from private firms | PolitiFact Vermon,"Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan began enforcing a new public records rule this month that sparked criticism from transparency advocates and politicians on both sides of the aisle. 
The rule prevents members of the public from photographing records they are examining unless they pay a fee to reimburse staff for the cost of preparing the documents. 
Gov. Phil Scott and Secretary of State Jim Condos have said that there is no legal basis for the government to charge members of the public to take photos of records. The attorney general says he interprets the law differently.
Defending his new policy, Donovan has argued that taxpayers should be reimbursed for the time it takes his staff to locate, scrutinize and redact records before inspection—particularly when the majority of requests don't come from members of the public, or the press, but private entities. 
""Most of the requests for records possessed by the Attorney General’s Office are from private law firms and companies,"" Donovan wrote in an op-ed published by VTDigger last week. 
""There is a cost to Vermonters associated with diverting attorney time and resources from my office’s mission,"" he added. ""More to the point, should we provide free legal work to law firms and companies that may take an adverse position to the policies of our state?"" 
VTDigger has already asked Donovan’s office to reverse its policy on photographing records. But his justification for it raised even more questions. Do ""most"" requests to his office really come from companies and law firms? 
On Thursday, a day before Donovan's op-ed was published, his office reported that 49% of the public records requests the attorney general's office received this year have come from companies. As of Monday, the office said that number had dropped slightly, to about 45%. 
Out of the 126 requests submitted to the attorney general this year, 32 came from members of the press, and 37 came from citizens acting independently, according to a review of the requests submitted to the office which are publicly available online. 
The remaining 57 requests—45.2%— came from companies, law firms and non-profits, which the attorney general's office lumps into one category, ""firms,"" when it tracks incoming records requests, according to Charity Clark, Donovan's chief of staff. 
Within this category, it’s true that law offices and private companies filed most of the requests. But nine of the requests in this category came from non-profits, interest groups and, in one case, a law school. 
Four of the requests came from Energy Policy Advocates, a conservative-leaning non-profit dedicated to bringing ""transparency to the realm of energy and environmental policy."" 
Also among the requesters categorized as ""firms"" were the National Consumer Law Center, a non-profit that focuses on legal and policy work for low income citizens; the Public Rights Project, an organization that advances civil rights and economic justice policies; and Judicial Watch, another right-leaning non-profit focused on government transparency.
A request from Vermont Legal Aid and another from a student at the University of Chicago School of Law were also included in the ""firms"" category. 
Clark said that the attorney general's office has been tracking public records requests like this for years, starting before Donovan took office. 
""Something that's not a citizen and not a member of the press is going to be in this other group,"" she said. 
However, Donovan referred to this entire class of requesters as ""private law firms and companies,"" a description that should not encompass universities, non-profit public interest groups and legal support clinics.
If the ""firms"" category excluded non-profits, there would be nine fewer requests: meaning the total number of from private law firms and companies would only be to 38% of all requests. 
Our Ruling 
Donovan is correct to say that private law firms and companies frequently ask his office for records—dozens have placed requests this year. 
Technically, their requests don't make up the majority of those the state has received in 2019, although requests from ""firms"" (as defined by the AG’s office) came only one percentage point short of 50% when Donovan made his statement last week. 
But because of the attorney general's methodology for tracking records, non-profit interest groups, a well-respected university, and a legal aid clinic are also included in his tally of  ""private law firms and companies"" seeking documents. 
The way Donovan’s office classifies record requesters and his public statements regarding those entities don’t square up.

That’s because Trump hasn’t sued CNN — but he’s threatened to.

The letter calls on executives to ""discuss an appropriate resolution of this matter"" that would include a ""substantial payment"" to cover damages.
""Never in the history of this country has a president been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called ‘mainstream’ news, as the current situation,"" the letter says. ""My clients intend to file legal action against you to seek compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, reimbursement of legal costs, and all other available legal and equitable remedies, to the maximum extent permitted by law.""
The letter doesn’t mention ""pro-impeachment bias"" though the Washington Examiner among others described the president’s charges against CNN that way. 
The letter to CNN was signed by attorney Charles Harder, who represented Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that took down Gawker and who has sent similar threats to other media for Trump. Last year, Harder suggested the president would sue the New York Times for what he called a ""highly defamatory"" story. He threatened to sue author Michael Wolff for libel over Wolff’s book, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.""
So far, though, no lawsuits have been filed. And Rebecca Tushnet, a professor of false advertising law at Harvard Law School, told Reuters that Trump’s latest salvo has ""no merit"" and that she doubted a lawsuit would ever be filed.

Spoiler: McGurk’s claim is spot-on.
The latest on Syria, American troops
McGurk said he got his numbers from the Pentagon, which touted its troop commitments in an Oct. 11 press release announcing the deployment of about 3,000 U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia. 
The press release said the Pentagon had ""increased the number of forces by approximately 14,000 to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility"" since May. Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeated the same figures while briefing reporters that same day.
The Pentagon told us the term ""area of responsibility"" refers to ""the entire Middle East,"" while Will Todman, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it also includes Afghanistan and other parts of central Asia. (Definitions of the Middle East vary.)
But Todman said the recent reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan likely means more have been deployed to the Middle East anyway. 
So yes, Trump has sent 14 times as many soldiers to the Middle East as the approximately 1,000 troops that he pledged to remove when he announced his decision to pull out of Syria.
""Trump is using the rhetoric of ending endless war, but in reality he is waging more war,"" said Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank. ""In the Middle East, he is simply moving troops from one region to another. But relocation is not departure.""
On Oct. 19, Esper said the soldiers in northeast Syria would be relocated to western Iraq where they would ""help defend Iraq"" and fight against ISIS. 
More recently, Esper said the United States was considering leaving some troops behind to secure the region’s oil fields, according to the Associated Press. Troops began withdrawing to Iraq on Oct. 21, per the Wall Street Journal.
Experts told us it’s difficult to determine how U.S. forces are distributed in the Middle East, in part because of changes former Defense Secretary James Mattis made to reduce transparency. 
According to June data from the Pentagon — which omits numbers for countries with ongoing operations such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan — there were at that time 283 total U.S. forces in Egypt, 76 in Israel, 20 in Lebanon, 1,750 in Turkey, 84 in Jordan, 2,077 in Kuwait, 535 in Saudi Arabia, 19 in Yemen, 17 in Oman, 374 in the United Arab Emirates, 636 in Qatar, and 4,865 in Bahrain. 
Those numbers include active duty personnel, national guard and reserve personnel and civilian personnel. According to the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a London think tank, they do not include temporary forces or classified special forces operating in secret.  
The June numbers are also outdated. The Pentagon told us it would not identify the recently deployed personnel by country, but it said more than 6,500 of the 14,000 soldiers sent out since May are at sea as part of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group.
Still, experts told us the largest numbers of U.S. forces currently stationed in or near the Middle East are likely in Bahrain, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Afghanistan.
Our ruling
McGurk said, ""President Trump has sent 14,000 American troops to the (Middle East) region since May. So he can't tell his political rallies that he's getting troops out of endless wars when he's sending 14 times the amount back into the region.""
His number matches what the Pentagon has publicly reported in press releases and briefings.

1,"AARP backed ""federal funding for Planned Parenthood.""","on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/22/association-mature-american-citizens/online-ads-claiming-aarp-backed-federal-funding-pl/,False,Association of Mature American Citizens,Online ads claiming AARP backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood are wrong,"In Facebook ads that launched in August featuring Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, and conservative radio talk show host Dennis Prager, older Americans are urged to forgo their AARP memberships for another organization: the Association of Mature American Citizens, otherwise known as AMAC. 
The ads say they were sponsored and paid for by AMAC, and they challenge the idea that AARP is a ""nonpartisan organization.""
""But you need to understand WHAT you are supporting if you are an AARP member,"" they continue. ""AARP backed Obamacare, strict gun control, and federal funding for Planned Parenthood. AMAC fought AGAINST all of these things."" 
We found a number of other posts on Facebook in which users claimed AARP ""supports abortion,"" a service many Planned Parenthood clinics provide. 
We wondered if the AMAC ads were correct to say that AARP backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. 
In an email, AMAC political liaison Ellen Cora told us that as an American over the age of 65 — and an AARP member herself — she recalls AARP bulletins that spoke ""positively about Planned Parenthood,"" adding ""we often refer to ‘AARP Beyond the Veil’ for more information about AARP.""
""Behind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn’t Know,"" was a 2011 report prepared by U.S. Reps. Wally Herger, R.-Calif, and Dave Reichert, R.-Wash. It was released as a House subcommittee opened a hearing examining AARP’s tax-exempt status.
CNN then reported that Republicans were targeting the group in the wake of the report that claimed to expose ""the conflict between AARP’s drive for profits, the best interests of its members and the organization’s tax-exempt status."" 
Democrats argued the attacks stemmed from AARP’s support of then-President Barack Obama’s health care bill, according to CNN.
But the report makes no mention of Planned Parenthood.
When we followed up, Jeff Szymanski, another AMAC political liaison, said he recalled ""it was a radio personality that made the claim you cite, not AMAC.""
The language in the ad featuring radio personality Dennis Prager is virtually identical to the ad featuring Sebastian Gorka. They both link to AMAC’s website and say they are sponsored and paid for by AMAC.
 


 
We asked Szymanski if AMAC didn’t write the ads but he didn’t reply. Instead, he directed PolitiFact to a page about AARP on the website 2ndVote.com, which calls itself the ""conservative watchdog for corporate activism."" Under a section labeled ""life,"" the page says: ""AARP is a corporate supporter of the National Women’s Law Center, which is a pro-abortion organization.""
It links to the National Women’s Law Center’s 2013-14 report, which lists AARP among the organizations that contributed $25,000-$49,999 to the center in the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2014. 2ndVote.com also links to a fact sheet the center produced about marriage equality. It doesn’t mention abortion, though. 
The National Women’s Law Center advocates for gender justice, according to its website, ""working across the issues that are central to the lives of women and girls."" Its issues include child care, racial justice, and health care and reproductive rights. Abortion, according to the center, ""is a key part of women’s liberty, equality, and economic security.""     
In 2013, the center produced a fact-sheet called ""The Hyde Amendment Hurts Women."" The amendment says the federal government can’t pay for abortions except when the mother’s life is in danger or if she became pregnant as a result of rape or incest, and the center calls it a ""hurtful ban"" that harms low-income women. 
We emailed AARP to ask about AMAC’s claim and supporting evidence. Spokesman Jason Young confirmed that AARP made a donation to the center and pointed us to an IRS filing that says AARP donated $25,000 that year ""to support the protect and improve Social Security for women project.""
Social Security is another of the law center’s issues. On its website, it says it works with lawmakers to develop proposals to strengthen Social Security and increase benefits to improve women’s retirement security.
In 2013, Young said, AARP, the law center and and other groups opposed ""chained CPI,"" which the Washington Post describes in this explainer as ""a way to index spending and taxes — including Social Security benefits — to the rate of inflation, or the rise in prices over time."" Social Security benefits would have increased at a slower rate using this index and AARP, among others, considered it an unjustifiable cut to Social Security benefits.
AARP ""does not have a position on abortion,"" Young said. ""AARP does not fund and has not funded Planned Parenthood. AARP has not supported or lobbied for federal funding for Planned Parenthood."" 
He also noted that JPMorgan Chase, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citi among others contributed to the National Women’s Law Center the same year AARP did. 
Planned Parenthood Federation of America was another of the center’s supporters that year, kicking in $5,000-$9,999. The organization historically received federal funding through Medicaid reimbursements for preventive care and Title X, a Health and Human Services grant program that funds comprehensive family planning services. However, Planned Parenthood and others are banned from using federal funds for abortion services except in instances of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is in danger. And, recently, because of a Trump administration rule that would deny Title X funds to any health clinics that refer women for abortions, Planned Parenthood has opted — for now — not to participate in the program.  
The Affordable Care Act, the comprehensive health care law known as Obamacare, did not designate any funds to Planned Parenthood in particular, said Benjamin Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Rather, he told us, it expanded health insurance to 20 million people, and some of those people may have gotten care at Planned Parenthood. 
""But it seems a stretch to argue that AARP support for the ACA was directly advocating funds to Planned Parenthood any more than it was advocating sending funds to any qualifying health care provider nationally — of which there are thousands,"" he said. ""I think the more reasonable interpretation is that AARP was supporting expanded health insurance, not advocating for any particular health care provider.""
Gretchen Ely, a professor at the University of Buffalo’s School of Social Work, echoed that sentiment. 
""It seems especially far-fetched in this particular example, given AARP’s focus on folks who are aging into retirement,"" she said.
In November 2009, when AARP endorsed the Affordable Health Care for America Act — the House’s version of the health care reform legislation — Barry Rand, then AARP’s CEO, said in a statement, that the bill contained ""critical components AARP has been fighting for on behalf of its members and all older Americans to improve health care for them and their families."" 
He cited examples, including ""protecting and strengthening Medicare for today’s seniors and future generations of retirees"" and ""lowering drug costs for seniors."" He doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood, family planning or abortion.
More recently, in 2017, AARP opposed the American Health Care Act, the GOP health care bill that would have repealed a large swath of Obamacare. Among its provisions, the measure also effectively blocked Planned Parenthood from securing reimbursements from Medicaid for a year. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska., and Susan Collins, R-Maine — who alongside Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joined Democrats to kill the bill in the Senate — had cited Planned Parenthood funding as one of the conditions of their support for the bill.
AARP published a post on its website in June 2017 titled, ""5 ways the Senate health care bill would hurt you."" But it focused on ""skyrocketing insurance premiums,"" coverage and Medicare services, not Planned Parenthood funding.  
To claim they opposed the bill because of Planned Parenthood is a ""fully misleading assertion,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor at George Washington University.
What’s more, Rosenbaum told us, while AARP has advocated for health benefits and women’s preventive health services, she’s unaware of any specific lobbying or advocacy AARP has done for Planned Parenthood. 
""It would be so totally unlike them to advocate for another organization,"" she said, ""it doesn’t make any sense.""
Our ruling
AMAC claims that AARP has backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
It’s tenuous to say an organization wants to use taxpayer dollars for Planned Parenthood because it once donated to a law center that supports abortion access in addition to seeking fair pay equity, family tax credits, affirmative action and fighting cuts to Social Security. AARP does not have a published position on abortion, or federal funding for abortion. Its health care advocacy centers on issues relevant to older Americans, like Social Security benefits, prescription drug pricing and elder abuse in nursing facilities.

1,"""Hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages. That means it is going to be something that will replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete.""","on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/oct/22/nikki-fried/will-hemp-replace-plastics-and-concrete-florida-de/,Mostly False,Nikki Fried,"25,000 uses for hemp, including a replacement for concrete and plastic? Not so fast | PolitiFact Florid","Hemp has been used inside a BMW electric car, as fiber in jeans and in the walls of a Tarpon Springs, home.
Now Florida’s lone statewide elected Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, will oversee a new state industrial hemp program. Fried, a former lobbyist for the marijuana industry, says that hemp has a massive number of uses and will replace some common materials.
""What most people don’t understand is that hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages,"" she said at a Florida Democratic Party conference in Orlando. ""That means it is going to be something that is going to replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete."" 
That’s a giant heap of hemp. But is Fried’s claim accurate?
While hemp and marijuana are from the same species of plant, hemp is nonpsychoactive and is used for a variety of products. Industry-friendly legislation has helped to grow the hemp market in recent years.
But don’t expect it to replace plastics or concrete anytime soon. Vast research and development — and money — is needed before widespread utilization.
""Industrial hemp products offer an alternative to materials like plastic and concrete in certain applications, but will never be able to fully replace them due to differences in the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials,"" said Tai Olson, who works for US Heritage Group, which works with suppliers for hempcrete projects. 
Claim about 25,000 uses from 1938
Fried’s claim about the number of uses for hemp comes from a magazine story published 80 years ago.
In 1938, Popular Mechanics magazine declared hemp the new ""billion dollar crop."" 
""Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great tensile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than 5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the wood ‘hurdes’ remaining after the fiber has been removed contains more than 77% cellulose, and can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to cellophane.""
The magazine story, however, did not account for government regulation that stymied hemp development. In 1937, Congress passed a law, which required hemp farmers to register and pay a tax.
But the 25,000-uses statistic lived on, even earning a mention in a 2018 Congressional Research Service report. 
Fried’s spokesman noted that report as well as other citations by news outlets including the Tampa Bay Times, Florida government and academic works. (PolitiFact Missouri also cited the figure, we found.) 
We sent Fried’s citations to four academic experts on hemp, and none was swayed.
""Just because a number is repeated over and over does not make it true,"" agriculture scientist Jennifer Gilbert Jenkins told us. Gilbert Jenkins is a professor at the State University of New York at Morrisville.
Hemp has multiple uses within agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverages, paper, construction materials, and personal care. 
A few experts in hemp told us the math behind 25,000 uses (and especially 35,000) is empty. 
""Of course it’s misleading, since defining what a ‘use’ is is arbitrary, and most uses would be economically insignificant,"" said Ernest Small, a research scientist in Canada. ""But the same could be said about numerous things, so it’s not exactly untruthful. With some imagination, I think you could find 25,000 uses for a car, or for many common things.""
Back to the source, Popular Mechanics. Jared W. Nelson, a mechanical engineer at SUNY New Paltz, told us he thinks the reported number of uses does not specifically refer to hemp, but instead refers to cellulose. Dynamite and cellophane are derived from cellulose.
While hemp could provide sugars through the enzymatic breakdown of cellulose, it’s a lot easier and cheaper to get those sugars from corn starch or sugar cane, said Cornell professor Lawrence B. Smart.
""The 25,000 products is a great number, but please put it in context,"" Smart said. ""Since we get most of our paper products from eucalyptus and lumber products from pine, how many products can you make from eucalyptus and pine?"" 
Hemp’s on the rise, but future hard to predict
What matters most, said Gilbert Jenkins, is ""for the first time in a generation we are able to innovate around this versatile crop.""
The 2018 farm bill legalized industrial use of hemp and removed it from the federal list of controlled substances, opening up the market to new products. According to Vote Hemp,  the number of acres of grown hemp tripled between 2017 and 2018, and hemp-based product sales have also climbed.
Fried’s spokesman Franco Ripple pointed to examples of hemp being used in hempcrete to build homes, composites to build products like cars, and hemp-based packaging and plastic alternatives. Hemp-based products should increasingly replace specific uses of Styrofoam, plastic, and concrete, he added.
""Her forward-looking statements on the future of hemp and potential uses are intended to inspire the industry’s development,"" he said, citing predictions about the future growth of hemp. 
But there are challenges to using hemp in the United States.
For example, Gilbert Jenkins is partnering with the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York to make hemp jeans.  
""We are in the process of sending a bale of hemp fiber to Poland to be processed into yarn because that capability does not exist in the United States currently,"" she said. ""Our textile industry is set up to work with cotton short fibers, not long hemp fibers.""
As for Ripple’s examples, they don’t represent the majority of current hemp use.
About 80 percent of hemp grown in the United States is for hemp extracts including cannabidiol, or CBD, said Eric Steenstra, Vote Hemp’s president. 
Experts also told us that hempcrete is intended to replace other components within a wall, such as sheetrock, and not the concrete itself.
Also, hemp won’t replace plastics. Hemp fibers can be used to strengthen plastics and other composite materials. Hemp oil can replace the petroleum oil raw material for the plastic, which ""is still plastic with all of its downsides,"" said Gilbert Jenkins.
Hemp has scarcely penetrated the building and plastic replacement markets, Small said. ""The future seems limited, albeit not impossible.""
Our ruling
Fried said, ""Hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages. That means it is going to be something that is going to replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete."" 
The number comes from a Popular Mechanics article in 1938 about the number of potential products that creates an overly optimistic picture of the number of uses. Just because a use exists does not mean that it is commonly available. Most hemp grown now is for CBD.
Fried said that hemp products will ""replace"" such common materials as plastics and concrete, but we found no evidence that hemp has the physical properties to truly replace these materials.
The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False."
1,"""Sheila Bynum-Coleman said, ‘We need to get the police out of the schools.’""","on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/oct/22/kirk-cox/cox-ad-distorts-bynum-coleman-statement-police-sch/,Mostly False,Kirk Cox,Cox ad distorts Bynum-Coleman statement on police in schools | PolitiFact Virgin,"House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, has been running a TV ad accusing his opponent, Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman, of wanting to remove police from public schools.
The ad starts with a narrator saying ""Sheila Bynum-Coleman said…"" and cuts to a tape of the candidate saying, ""We need to get the police out of the schools. Get the police out of the schools.""
Then the ad shows four ""real moms, not actors,"" sitting at a kitchen table, holding coffee mugs and disagreeing with Bynum-Coleman.
""That’s scary,"" the first woman says. ""I don’t want my kids in an environment where they’re not going to be safe.""
The second woman says police are ""heroes."" The third says the officers are at schools  ""as an added layer of protection."" The fourth says, ""I just want my daughter to be safe.""
The ad returns to the first woman, who says, ""As a mom, I wouldn’t vote for Sheila Bynum-Coleman. I just wouldn’t.""
During much of commercial, there’s type on the screen saying, ""We need to get the police out of the schools - Sheila Bynum-Coleman.""
Bynum-Coleman says Cox has distorted comments she made two years ago. So we fact-checked Cox’s ad claim.
The commercial cites as its source an Oct. 9, 2017 podcast interview of Bynum-Coleman by Marcello Rollando, a performing arts director and liberal activist. Bynum-Coleman was asked for her thoughts on the ""school to prison pipeline,"" the trend of a disproportionate number of black students being expelled from schools or arrested.
In a lengthy reply, Bynum-Coleman said many schools were relegating  routine student discipline to on-site police and security guards. She did say ""we need to get the police out of the schools,"" as Cox claims in his ad. But the commercial omits Bynum Coleman saying in her next breath the officers are needed to provide safety. 
Here are her expanded remarks:
""But now we have police in the school who are policing our children, you know we don’t want children to get into fights, we don’t want them walking into class late, we don’t want them being disruptive in the classrooms, but do we want to send them to prison?
""I think there’s an alternative here and I think we need to get the police out of the schools. The police need to be there for safety measures and to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions, and that’s what’s taking place.""
A few minutes later, Bynum-Coleman said, ""I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safer and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school.""
Rob Silverstein, Bynum-Coleman’s campaign manager, sent us an email calling Cox's ad ""incredibly misleading and deceptive, and it presents a clearly false impression of what she said.""
Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for Cox, stood by the ad. ""It's pretty hard to be a misrepresentation of Ms. Bynum-Coleman, when the ad uses a recording of her own words,"" he said.
Our ruling
Cox’s ad says ""Sheila Bynum-Coleman said, ‘We need to get the police out of schools.’""
Bynum-Coleman used those words in a lengthy answer she gave to a question about the ""prison-to-school pipeline,"" affecting many black students. 
But in her next sentence, she explained that police ""need"" to be on hand ""to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions and that’s what’s taking place.""
And she elaborated a few minutes later, ""I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safe and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school.""
Cox ignores this easily available context and, in an era of mass shootings, misleadingly creates the impression that Bynam-Coleman said she would leave schools unprotected. 
We rate Cox’s claim Mostly False."
1,"Says drinking a ""6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed"" will help alleviate restless legs syndrome.","on Monday, October 21st, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/21/facebook-posts/no-drinking-tonic-water-isnt-proven-method-allevia/,False,Facebook posts,"No, drinking tonic water isn’t a proven method to alleviate restless legs syndrome | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","A Facebook post that’s been shared over 55,000 times claims that a little trick before bed each night may cure your restless legs syndrome. 
The post reads: 
""Restless Legs Syndrome: Drink a 6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed until symptoms go away. Tonic water contains quinine, which stops repeated muscle contractions -Paul Lyons, MD.""
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
While medical experts say it’s probably not harmful to consume a small cup of tonic water each night, it’s not scientifically proven to help cure or alleviate restless legs syndrome, a condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move your legs, usually at night or while lying down.
Prevention Magazine, a healthy lifestyle magazine published by the Hearst Corporation, is listed as the source of the post. We found a 2016 article from the magazine titled ""14 Natural Ways To Deal With Restless Legs Syndrome."" (We also came across a 2008 story by ABC News that mirrors the post’s wording.)
About halfway through the Prevention Magazine article, the tonic water method is mentioned:
""... The FDA has banned the sale of quinine because it reportedly caused some serious side effects (though rare), but it's still available in one form, Qualaquin, for the treatment of malaria, and it's still available in very small amounts in tonic water. So even though studies show it doesn't work, and even though tonic water contains only a token amount of quinine—an 8-ounce glass of tonic water has about 20 mg, compared with the 200 to 300 mg dose you'd need to quiet leg cramps—some patients swear by it."" 
It continues to cite a medical consultant from the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation who said that although it may not be supported by science, a home remedy that couldn’t hurt and could help is worth a try.
But while the low amount of quinine found in tonic water is not considered harmful, the Food and Drug Administration has warned that the research for the use of quinine products for leg cramps or similar conditions is out-of-date, and that ""there has been significant concern regarding its unfavorable risk/benefit ratio."" 
Most medical professionals also say people shouldn’t rely on the tonic water tactic.
Dr. Mark Buchfuhrer, a restless legs syndrome expert and member of the RLS Foundation's scientific and medical advisory board, told PolitiFact that quinine has no benefit for treating the disorder.
""The typical dose of Quinine for leg cramps is more than 200-300 mg. A 6 ounce glass of tonic water contains less than 15 mg of quinine. One would have to drink close to a gallon of tonic water to get the therapeutic effect for leg cramps,"" Buchfuhrer wrote in an email. ""It is one of these ‘Urban Legends’ that may possibly be true for one leg condition then gets spread to other conditions that may affect the legs ...There are likely many patients who believe that both treatments are effective for RLS but they likely work through the strong placebo effect.""
While clinical evidence shows that quinine helps leg cramps, Buchfuhrer said, few decent medical studies back that up. He recommended other treatments such as regular exercise, avoiding exacerbating drugs like antihistamines, antidepressants; increasing iron levels if they are low, and avoiding alcohol.
Doctors Hope Ricciotti and Hye-Chun Hur also wrote for Harvard Medical School about the lack of science behind the tonic water method and list other ways people can alleviate RLS symptoms: 
""Drinking a few ounces of tonic water shouldn't be harmful, but it isn't likely to prevent your leg cramps."" 
They instead recommend ""making sure to get enough fluids, avoiding caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, stretching during the day or before bed, and, when a cramp starts, standing on the affected leg, applying ice or heat and gently massaging the affected muscle.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims that drinking a 6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed can help alleviate symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome.
It’s not considered harmful to consume a glass of tonic water, but the home remedy is not scientifically proven to help with RLS. Medical experts usually don’t recommend the treatment and instead suggest the people take other action to relieve symptoms, including talking to their doctors.

O’Rourke replied: 
""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns.

Those must be bought back or else each of them are an instrument potentially of terror in this country.""
In reality, O’Rourke’s answer isn’t clear at all. We’ll help you sort out the mental gymnastics.
The targeted weapons
In both the El Paso and the Dayton mass shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic — the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger — and carried enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes. 
The El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds.
The Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds.
O’Rourke’s previous rhetoric
At least two times previously, O’Rourke was asked whether he would support confiscation of guns he calls weapons of war. He said yes.

You've said, quote, ‘Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.’ You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?""
O’Rourke: ""I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. ...When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland (Texas), there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.""
Sept. 18 CNN’s ""Cuomo Prime Time
Host Chris Cuomo: ""All right, so let's state the proposition. Are you, in fact, in favor of gun confiscation?
O'Rourke: ""Yes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield. ...So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes. But when it comes to firearms used for hunting or self-defense, the answer is no.""
How else O’Rourke has described his proposal
On the same day as the ""Morning Joe"" interview, CNN ""New Day"" host Alysin Camerota asked O’Rourke: ""How do you plan to get assault weapons away from people who don’t want to give them up?""
O’Rourke replied: ""It’s pretty simple. As with any law in this country, we would expect our fellow Americans to follow the law.""
Later, Camerota pushed back by saying mass shooters would not follow such a law. Then she said of O’Rourke’s proposal: ""It sounds like confiscation."" 
O’Rourke replied: ""No, I’m not suggesting that. And I think that’s why people use the word confiscation, because it scares people. What I’m talking about is a mandatory buyback, where Americans who own an AR-15 or an AK-47 will sell that weapon back to the government. 
O’Rourke made similar comments on ""Morning Joe.""
Scarborough asked what the federal government would do if owners of AR-15s and AK-47s refused to sell. O’Rourke said:
""Just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law. So, in that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.""
(Update: We’ve added some additional context from O’Rourke’s statement after initially publishing this fact-check.) 
Asked later in the interview about going door to door to take conventional handguns, O’Rourke said they aren’t as lethal as assault-style weapons and there is a legitimate use of handguns for protection in a home.
To confiscate or not ...
O’Rourke’s campaign website says he is calling for ""a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns,"" and that ""individuals who fail to participate in the mandatory buyback of assault weapons will be fined.""
""Beto has been clear that he is talking about a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, which is not confiscation,"" his campaign told us.
O’Rourke’s argument that his plan isn’t confiscation ultimately rests on the fact that the government would buy the guns away from its owner. But that’s misleading.
Gun owners wouldn’t have a say in the matter, and just because they’d be compensated, some likely wouldn’t see the trade in terms of equal value. Owners would be required to sell, and if they didn’t, what happens next is murky.
O’Rourke says people might be fined, and that they might be somehow compelled to turn their weapons in through the buy-back program. As you game out scenarios how this might play out, they all lead to something that most people would consider confiscation.
Clearly, many gun owners who legally purchased and own weapons that the government would take would view that as confiscation, even if they were paid for the guns.
""It is unreasonable to call what Mr. O’Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation,"" gun law expert George Mocsary, a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told PolitiFact.
""Imagine the situation when an owner of one of the weapons refuses to sell. He or she is issued a fine. The owner still has the weapon, however. Does paying the fine mean that he or she can now keep the weapon and it is perfectly legal?  Certainly not,"" Mocsary said.
""There is no scenario under which the owner of one of the designated weapons gets to keep it. That is confiscation.""
Our ruling
O’Rourke said: ""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns.""
O’Rourke has said ""yes"" and ""hell, yes"" when asked about confiscating assault-style weapons. And his mandatory buyback proposes taking those weapons from people, even if it involves a purchase.
We rate O’Rourke’s claim that he is ""not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns"" as False."
2,"Says California has ""30% or a third of the country’s people living at or below the poverty level.""","on Sunday, October 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/oct/20/mark-batinick/no-30-nations-poor-dont-reside-california/,False,Mark Batinick,"No, 30% of the nation’s poor don’t reside in California | PolitiFact Illinois","In the thick of tax policy debates, Illinois politicians often point to other states to make their case.
And this year has been no exception in Illinois’ most pitched policy battle — the debate over whether to replace Illinois’ current flat-rate income tax with a graduated system in which taxpayers with more income would pay higher rates. We’ve already fact-checked several claims from Illinois politicians — including Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is spearheading the push — about how states with graduated tax systems are functioning.
Last week, we heard a new one. It was a striking criticism of California, a graduated-tax state, from a suburban Republican lawmaker opposed to Pritzker’s plan.
During a conversation about the graduated income tax on a WCPT-AM talk show, a caller mentioned California in a positive light. In response, GOP state Rep. Mark Batinick of Plainfield, cautioned against using the state as a model for policy in Illinois.
""The people being hurt in California — I think it has 30% or a third of the country’s people living at or below the poverty level,"" Batinick said.
While California’s poverty rate ranks among the nation’s highest, federal data show the state is far from being home to a third of the nation’s poor.
Census results
The federal government measures poverty several different ways. For comparing poverty figures nationally, the U.S. Census Bureau recommends using data from the Current Population Survey, its official source for national poverty estimates.
The survey contradicts Batinick’s claim. California’s share of those in the U.S. living below the poverty line is just over 12%, according to the latest data. That mirrors its share of the nation’s population overall.
The Census also releases a supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for cost-of-living — including taxes, housing, medical costs and non-cash benefits people can put toward their basic needs. Its most recent release gives California a larger share of those living in poverty nationwide, but still falls well below what Batinick said. Here, the math works out to just below 17%.
Researchers say the supplemental measure does a better job at capturing poverty, but it’s still not perfect — including for California, where housing costs are high.
Zach Parolin, a research scientist at the Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University, suggested looking at ""food insecurity"" — a separate federal ranking measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — to add to the picture of economic hardship in California. When comparing by state how accessible food is for members of households to live active and healthy lives, California performs better than the national average.
California vs. Illinois and Batinick’s response
California’s graduated income tax starts with a rate of 1% for those making the least and then increases by marginal rates before topping out at 13.3% for earnings over $1 million, according to the Tax Foundation.
Pritzker's plan — approved by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly earlier this year — would tax those making less than $250,000 at the state’s current rate of 4.95%. Rates would go up on earnings above that amount. The highest rate calls for a 7.99% tax on the entire income of single filers who make more than $750,000 and joint filers who earn more than $1 million.
The law won’t go into effect unless voters in November 2020 approve a constitutional amendment to permit graduated rates.
When we asked Batinick about the connection he was trying to draw, he told us he was underscoring his general point that California-style policies are not a panacea to the challenges facing Illinois.
As for the evidence behind his specific claim about poverty? Batinick acknowledged he was mistaken and said he should have referred to welfare recipients and not people below the poverty line.
Referencing a 2018 federal report that noted Californians make up 38% of families receiving benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, Batinick said he does not look at California as ""a state that I’m supposed to model.""
But that’s not what Batinick said on-air, where he referred specifically to the poverty line. And some experts we contacted expressed caution about drawing conclusions on poverty in California based on a single program, in part because the money that goes into TANF makes up a relatively small share of government spending in the universe of programs meant to assist people with low incomes.
Our ruling
Batinick said California is home to ""30% or a third of the country’s people living at or below the poverty level.""
Federal poverty measures show that figure is significantly overblown — a point Batinick conceded.
Instead, he said he meant to reference the state’s share of welfare recipients and cited a federal report that noted more than a third of TANF recipients reside in California.
However, that particular federal program is far from the largest or only form of assistance the government provides to low-income individuals to help them with their basic needs. What’s more, it refers to something different than what Batinick originally said.
We rate his claim False.

FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

2,"Says Donald Trump ""will not be profiting"" from the G-7 summit meeting to be held at Trump’s Doral resort.","on Friday, October 18th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/18/mick-mulvaney/mulvaney-wrong-donald-trump-wont-profit-g7/,False,Mick Mulvaney,Mulvaney wrong that Donald Trump won't profit from choosing Trump resort to host G-7,"The trips that President Donald Trump has made as president to resorts he owns have raised questions about whether he has improperly enriched himself or violated the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits high-level U.S. officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign governments.
So, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was ready when he opened an Oct. 17 news conference by speaking about the annual Group of Seven summit. It had just been announced that the president decided the G-7 gathering of world leaders in June 2020 will be held at Trump National Doral, a 643-room golf resort outside Miami that advertises it as being ""infused with the Trump standard of excellence.""
""Again, anticipating your questions, how is this not an emoluments violation, is the president going to profit from this?"" Mulvaney said. ""I think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he’s got here that he doesn’t profit from being here, he has no interest in profit from being here; that’s one of the reasons that he’s not taken a salary since he’s been here, he’s given that salary to charity, will not be profiting here.""
At the very least, Trump can expect to profit from future business that will be generated at Doral as a result of hosting an exclusive, three-day summit that will get worldwide media coverage.
Prior bookings 
Since Trump took office, several foreign countries, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Philippines, have hosted national holiday celebrations at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. We found that the Saudi government spent $270,000 at the hotel between October 2016, the month before Trump’s election, and March 2017 alone.
Trump’s more than 100 trips as president to properties he owns, such as Doral, the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., and resorts in Los Angeles and Scotland, have brought those businesses at least $1.6 million in revenue, but probably much more, the Washington Post reported in June 2019. The revenue comes from federal officials and others who pay to stay where Trump stays.
‘At cost’
The White House and Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back up Mulvaney’s claim that Trump wouldn’t be profiting from the G-7 summit. But Mulvaney did elaborate on his claim during the news conference.
Doral ""is doing this at cost,"" Mulvaney said. ""As a result, it’s actually dramatically cheaper for us to do it at Doral compared to the other final sites that we had.""
Asked by a reporter about the summit being a ""huge branding opportunity"" for Doral, Mulvaney downplayed the notion by noting Trump’s visits as president to Trump resorts. 
""Donald Trump’s brand is probably strong enough as it is and doesn’t need any more help on that,"" Mulvaney said. ""It’s the most recognizable name in the English language and probably around the world right now. So, that has nothing to do"" with Doral being chosen for the summit. 
Opportunity to profit
Trump has backed off day-to-day control of his businesses, but he’s still an owner. And, despite Mulvaney’s statement about the Trump brand, business at Doral is down. Profits have dropped 69% in three years, though Doral still provides Trump more revenue than any other hotel or golf club, according to the Post.
The G-7 is an event unlike any other and is held in the United States only every eight years. The summit, for discussing a broad range of issues, rotates among sites chosen by the seven member countries, as well as by the European Union.
It will draw seven foreign leaders, of France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, along with Trump. Plus, it will attract hundreds of diplomats, journalists and security personnel to Doral during one of its slowest months of the year for the resort — and attract worldwide attention.
And even if somehow the event would be structured so that Doral would only break even on room bookings, that doesn’t take into account other spending by guests while on the property.
""Filling the resort during the summer — the off-season in Florida — even ‘at cost,’ reduces overhead and contributes to the corporate bottom line,"" said Steven Schooner, professor of government procurement law at George Washington University. ""But, far more importantly, think of it as no-cost advertising or promotion investment. Having a resort property fill TV screens and newspaper pages with images of world leaders is the kind of publicity that's nearly impossible to put a price on.""
The publicity surrounding such an event ""incredibly valuable to a resort's owner,"" said David Berins, co-founder and chairman emeritus of the International Society of Hospitality Consultants and a 53-year hotel industry veteran.
""The Trump Organization will not only benefit from the publicity in the form of future bookings,"" Berins said, ""but you can be sure that the resort will be chock-a-block with high-paying reporters, photographers, television crews and others who are billed separately from the event invoice not only during the summit but for many days before and after.""
""And, what does 'at cost' mean?"" Berins added. ""Will there be an allocation of the payroll for the accountants, the greenskeepers, the plumbers and painters, the electricity and water, or does it just mean the direct costs of the meet itself like tent rentals, food and beverage, and audio-visual equipment?  Will the costs of painting, replacing carpeting, and making everything look new and shiny be included?""
Our ruling
Mulvaney said Trump ""will not be profiting"" from the G-7 summit meeting to be held at Trump’s Doral resort.
The acting White House chief of staff says the Miami-area resort will host the gathering ""at cost."" But the White House did not explain how that would work.
Moreover, the summit is a one-of-a-kind event, attracting seven world leaders, hundreds of diplomats, journalists and other guests, and worldwide publicity. Even at cost, it fills the hotel during Florida’s slow season and guests would be doing other spending on the property even if the rooms were rented at break-even prices.
Mulvaney’s statement is inaccurate. We rate this claim False."
2,"""When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.""","on Friday, October 18th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/18/eric-trump/eric-trumps-false-claim-trump-family-got-out-all-i/,Pants on Fire!,Eric Trump,Eric Trump’s false claim that the Trump family ‘got out of all international business’,"Eric Trump, President Donald Trump’s second son, falsely claimed the Trump family children ""got out of all international business"" after their father took office.
""The difference between us and Hunter (Biden) is when my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business,"" he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in response to a question about the younger Biden’s ABC interview.  
The claim is the latest in the Trump team’s attacks against Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 contender. Facing an impeachment inquiry, the president has repeatedly charged, without evidence, that the elder Biden forced out Ukraine’s lead prosecutor to protect Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian company that was once under investigation. 
But as they accuse Hunter Biden of riding his family name to a fortune in Ukraine, the Trump children have put almost no stops to their own overseas business dealings, we found. 
Multiple news outlets and government accountability groups have documented international business dealings Eric Trump and his siblings have conducted since Donald Trump took office. In some cases, the Trump children themselves have celebrated their activities overseas.
Trump Organization leadership post-election
Before his inauguration, Donald Trump announced that he would be retaining ownership of the Trump Organization but transferring day-to-day control to his oldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. 
The move followed a post-election promise Trump made on Twitter, when he pledged that ""no new deals will be done during my term(s) in office."" He elaborated on that promise in a white paper detailing ethics rules the Trump Organization had agreed to observe. 
The white paper said the Trump Organization would function like an ""asset-management company,"" pursuing no new foreign deals and donating all profits from foreign officials’ use of Trump properties to the U.S. Treasury. (In February, the company said it turned over $191,538 to cover foreign profits from 2018.)
But Trump continues to make money from existing licensing and property deals sprawled across more than 20 countries, according to an analysis of Trump's foreign business interests from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group tracking money in politics.
The Trump campaign pointed to an article in The Hill and otherwise directed our inquiry to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Overseas dealings by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.
As a number of news outlets have reported, the Trump Organization has continued conducting business abroad.
""Eric Trump’s claim that ‘we got out of all international business’ is clearly and demonstrably false,"" said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government watchdog that tracks Trump’s conflicts of interest. ""Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have repeatedly traveled internationally to conduct business.""
In September, a local council in Scotland voted to let the company build 550 homes and a second golf course as an expansion of a Trump-owned golf course in the area. Eric Trump described the construction as ""a new phase of development"" in a celebratory tweet.
Congratulations to our extraordinary @TrumpScotland team! Minutes ago, we received full & total approval for a new phase of development to include 500 homes, 50 cottages, sports center, retail & more. We also received approval to build a 2nd golf course! Very proud of them! pic.twitter.com/odVxomGdmf— Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 26, 2019 
Also recently, the Trump Organization received approval to build 53 houses and a new ballroom at its seaside golf course in Ireland, according to the Washington Post. 
In addition to managing existing properties and licensures, the Trump brothers have built on deals that were already in the works or inked before Trump became president, in some cases going back and giving new life to old projects that had previously seemed abandoned.
""Some Trump-branded foreign projects have only been made public after Trump’s election and others have significantly expanded,"" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Projects that appeared to be long-forgotten or dormant were also revisited after Trump's election.""
In 2017, for example, Eric Trump went to the Dominican Republic to revive a deal from 2007. Trump Organization lawyers argued then that the deal was never dead and therefore did not count as the type of new foreign deal the company had promised to avoid. But according to the Associated Press, no new projects there had ""been built or announced in a decade.""
In 2018, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to sell condos at high-rises in India, where the Trump Organization has licensed its name to five projects on deals signed before the election. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2017 that promotional materials for one of those projects said buyers could be associated with ""celebrity & POTUS Donald Trump’s Trump Organisation,"" a move the Trump Organization blamed on a broker.
In August, Trump Jr. flew to Indonesia to promote two Trump-branded resorts that have yet to be built. Bookbinder noted that in an internal presentation, the Indonesian company building those properties said the Trump international portfolio had an ""aggressive global expansion underway,"" with ""numerous projects in the pipeline.""
The Trump Organization has been similarly involved in projects in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay, said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog group.
Amey pointed to articles in Politico, the Daily Beast and the Washington Post that described how providing Secret Service protection for the Trump brothers on their business trips has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.
""Let's not forget that each year President Trump lists numerous international ventures in his financial disclosure records,"" Amey said, adding that Eric Trump’s claim was ""incorrect.""
The brothers have also sold off many Trump real estate holdings, according to Forbes. In January 2018, they offloaded a piece of land in the Dominican Republic for $3.2 million, a move Forbes called ""the clearest violation of their father’s pledge to do no new foreign deals.""
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner
Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who both serve advisory roles in the White House, have also benefited from foreign business ties since Trump took office.
Ivanka Trump kept her international fashion business running for 18 months after her father was elected. Amid trade talks with China last year, she received a number of trademarks from the country related to a variety of her fashion products. She added more this year, as well.
""Certainly, filing for trademarks in an international country would count as international business,"" said Jessica Tillipman, assistant dean and a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
Kushner remains a partial owner of his family’s own real estate company, but he has divested some assets to a trust controlled by his mother, according to the New York Times. Last year, his company made a roughly $1 billion bailout deal with Brookfield Asset Management, which is partly owned by the government of Qatar, to save a failing New York property. 
Our ruling
Eric Trump said, ""When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.""
The Trump Organization said it would not make new foreign deals during Donald Trump’s presidency. But the Trump brothers have traveled across the globe, managing properties and taking action on deals that they say were signed or under works before Trump took office.
Regardless of whether these moves should be considered new foreign deals, it’s ridiculous to claim the Trump family children stopped all international business after their father’s election.

2,"Says Donald Trump is breaking a campaign pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania since the two states ""have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year.""","on Friday, October 18th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/18/democratic-national-committee/dnc-trump-manufacturing-jobs/,Mostly False,Democratic National Committee,"DNC off on Trump, Wisconsin manufacturing jobs | PolitiFact Wisconsin","If there’s one thing President Donald Trump can’t get enough of, it’s reminding the American people about the economy. 
And nearly three years into his presidency, it seems like his favorite topic is jobs. 
In 2016, Trump ran on promises to create millions of jobs and bring back work to traditional American blue-collar industries such as steel, manufacturing and coal mining. 
But the Democratic National Committee says the opposite has happened with manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- two states Trump narrowly carried over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
""Trump promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- that hasn’t happened,"" the DNC claimed in a Sept. 20, 2019 post on the ""War Room"" section of its website. ""Instead, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year."" 
Are they right?
Let’s dig into the numbers.
The jobs picture
The DNC ""War Room"" is a rapid response operation that writes quick statements based on opposition research against Trump and GOP campaigns.
When asked to provide backup, Daniel Wessel, the deputy War Room director, essentially repeated the claim from the site and pointed us to a Sept. 20, 2019 Bloomberg news report about the loss of factory jobs. The article noted Wisconsin and Pennsylvania led the nation, but took the same one-year approach from August 2018 to August 2019.
Using raw numbers, the two states did indeed have the biggest loss of manufacturing jobs from August 2018 to August 2019, according to a state employment survey released by the Labor Department. Wisconsin lost about 5,200 seasonally adjusted jobs, while Pennsylvania lost around 7,700.
The Wisconsin State Journal reported in an Oct. 10, 2019, article that Wisconsin’s manufacturing job loss was the largest year-over-year decline since the last recession. 
Case closed?
Not exactly.
First, on a percentage basis, other states had larger losses. 
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Maryland all lost a larger share of manufacturing jobs from August 2018 to August 2019. (Though, we should note, those states combined have fewer manufacturing jobs than either Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.)
More importantly, in arguing Trump is not fulfilling his promise as it relates to manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the DNC is using a narrow set of numbers -- a single year’s worth. But the president has been in office for nearly three years.
So, the DNC went cherry-picking and, not surprisingly, found a cherry.
The longer-range jobs picture is more complex.
Consider: The government’s latest jobs report showed 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost nationally in September 2019, compared to 18,000 jobs added in September 2018. 
Meanwhile, for all of 2018, there was an average increase of about 22,000 jobs per month. Through the first nine months of 2019, the increase has been about 5,000 jobs per month. 
In short, there’s been an uptick of manufacturing jobs under Trump -- an increase of about 373,000 jobs -- despite the current slowdown.
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania: The longer view
All told, Wisconsin has about 472,000 manufacturing jobs while Pennsylvania has about 562,000.
From January 2017, when Trump took office, until August 2019, Wisconsin went from about 465,000 manufacturing jobs to 472,000 -- an increase of 1.5%.
Pennsylvania had about 561,000 manufacturing jobs when Trump took office. As of August 2019, the state sat at slightly over 562,000 jobs, a 0.2% increase. 
So both states have actually seen an increases in these jobs, albeit modest ones.
Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University, said manufacturing jobs have been in decline over the Midwest for most of the past year due to the ongoing trade war with China.
""The trade war is both directly contributing to this by increasing the costs of production and by causing supply chain disruptions which reduce demand for exported goods,"" Hicks said. 
Hicks said that leads to factory job losses.
The even bigger picture
Sometimes, where you end up depends on where you begin.
Consider Barack Obama’s tenure, when manufacturing jobs faced an ebb and flow largely due to the turbulent economy.
When Obama took office in January 2009, the nation had 12.6 million manufacturing jobs. This was in the midst of the Great Recession, which led to a low point of 11.5 million manufacturing jobs -- a loss of some 900,000 -- roughly a year later, in February 2010.
!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"");
So, if you measured just that window, you’d get a worse picture than if you looked at Obama’s full term.
But from February 2010 until Obama left office in January 2017, there was an increase of more than 900,000 manufacturing jobs, hitting a total of 12.4 million.
It was an overall loss, as PolitiFact National has noted, of about 192,000 manufacturing jobs. But much smaller than if you pulled out a single year. 
Our rating
The DNC claims Trump is breaking a campaign pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania since the two states ""have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year.""
We found data from the Labor Department showing Wisconsin and Pennsylvania lost the most jobs over the last year compared to the rest of the country, at least in raw numbers. 
But they weren’t the worst on a percentage basis. And the two states have seen a modest uptick in manufacturing jobs since Trump took office. So it’s not accurate to use that cherry-picked data as evidence Trump has broken his promise on growing manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
The definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""
That’s what we rate this claim."

Is the number that large? When we reached out to Ojeda, he said we should look at the federal statistics and ""just do the research."" 
We did, and we found that his numbers were actually an understatement. 
The official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the number of gun-related deaths nationally. The most recent year for which data is available is 2017. Here are the figures:
Homicides: 14,542 deaths by guns
Suicides: 23,854 deaths by guns
Other: 1,377 deaths by guns
Total deaths by guns: 39,773
That works out to 3,314 total gun-related deaths nationally per month, and 1,212 gun-related homicides per month. Both figures are much higher than Ojeda’s estimate of 75 to 100 per month. 
However, Ojeda’s figures would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day. There are about 109 gun-related deaths per day, about 40 of which are homicides and 65 of which are suicides.
We also checked to see if the numbers work for firearm deaths in West Virginia alone. They don’t -- in this case, the number is too small. West Virginia saw 348 total deaths from guns in 2017, which works out to 29 per month, or close to one a day.
What about injuries? The CDC has data on that as well. 
In 2015, the most recent year available, there were 84,997 non-fatal injuries by guns nationally. That works out to 7,083 per month, a number well above the 200 Ojeda cited.
Here, too, the data fits better if it’s calculated on a per-day basis. There were about 233 non-fatal injuries per day. That’s not far off from the number Ojeda offered.
All told, though, his numbers are far off from what he said in the tweet.
Our ruling
Ojeda tweeted that ""75-100 folks (are) killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence.""
In fact, Ojeda understated the number of deaths and injuries from guns. His numbers are roughly right for gun deaths and injuries per day, rather than per month. 
We rate his statement Mostly False."
2,"""The City of Austin is dedicating more than $20,000 PER HOMELESS PERSON in Austin.""","on Thursday, October 17th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/oct/17/greg-abbott/how-much-does-city-austin-spend-homeless-person/,Half-True,Greg Abbott,"How much does the city of Austin spend, per homeless person? | PolitiFact Texas","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has the city of Austin in his sights.
The Republican governor has threatened state action if the Austin City Council does not take steps to address its decision to lift a ban on camping in public places that is aimed at homeless people.
In one of several tweets criticizing the city, Abbott suggested that local leaders are not directing available resources appropriately.
""The City of Austin is dedicating more than $20,000 PER HOMELESS PERSON in Austin,"" Abbott wrote in a tweet. ""The problem isn't resources. It's prioritization. It's inaction & word salad on an urgent public health & safety issue. Haven For Hope in San Antonio works. Lawlessness is never the answer.""
Haven for Hope is a shelter-like program in San Antonio that operates using private and government funding. In its latest budget, the city of San Antonio allocated more than $500,000 for the program.
Abbott repeated his estimate about Austin in an interview on Austin television station KXAN.
""The city of Austin is tapping into their taxpayers for more than $20,000 per homeless person,"" Abbott said. ""If they can’t get this problem fixed by spending $20,000 or more per homeless person, the problem is not the homeless. The problem is a lack of leadership in Austin, Texas.""
We had to ask: Is Abbott’s estimate accurate?
Sort of. While it is true that the city has allocated significant funding toward addressing homelessness, a large chunk of the funding is aimed at preventing homelessness, rather than going to programs to support individuals who are currently homeless.
Austin budget looks at future programs
Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the governor’s statement was based on the city’s current homeless population and its recently adopted budget.
""The current Austin homeless population is 2,255 according to ECHO,"" Wittman said in an email, referencing the non-profit Ending Community Homelessness Coalition. ""The current Austin budget calls for $62.7 million to be spent on homelessness initiatives. This breaks down to $27,804.88 per homeless person.""
The Ending Community Homelessness Coalition data Wittman pointed to came from the 2019 Point in Time Count, a count of an area’s homeless population, as required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
This year’s survey shows that there were 2,255 homeless people in Austin. Of those, 1,169 were sheltered and 1,086 were unsheltered.
Austin's homeless population has remained relatively steady over the past nine years, fluctuating from a high of 2,362 in 2011 to a low of 1,832 in 2015.
Wittman also shared links to news articles discussing Austin's proposed budget, including one from KXAN breaking down the dollars for homelessness.
""Another report from KXAN says the city is spending $37,000 per homeless person,"" Wittman said in his email.
The article explored the city’s budget proposal and included a calculation for how much money officials were planning to spend per homeless person during the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
Wittman got the figure from the article right, but left out a key detail.
""If you just look at the totals, it would appear the city is planning to spend $37,000 per homeless person,"" the article reads. ""However, most of this budget isn’t going to individuals but instead to programs aimed at keeping people off the street.""
Looking at the city 
The Austin City Council voted in September to approve a $4.2 billion budget, which included $62.7 million for programs aimed at homelessness, plus an additional $500,000 for crisis services and ""encampment cleanups.""
The funding is divided into three categories: housing displacement prevention, crisis mitigation and re-empowerment, according to a city budget document.
The budget allocates roughly $20.4 million for housing displacement prevention, which includes homelessness prevention services and emergency relocation services for people at risk of being displaced from their homes.
Funding under this umbrella goes toward keeping people in their houses, as opposed to services aiding individuals currently experiencing homelessness.
The budget also spends $23.9 million for ""crisis mitigation,"" which includes support for emergency shelters, mental health and substance use disorder treatment and outreach teams that identify and assist homeless people ""before they reach a state of crisis.""
The final $18.4 million is earmarked for creating and maintaining affordable housing and for contracting with local organizations to develop strategies for ending homelessness in the city.
Only one of the three budget categories goes directly to services for people currently experiencing homelessness: the $23.9 million for ""crisis mitigation.""
That would be roughly $10,000 per homeless person.
Our ruling
Abbott said, ""The City of Austin is dedicating more than $20,000 PER HOMELESS PERSON in Austin.""
The math behind Abbott’s claim checks out for the overall budget for homeless initiatives — $62.7 million — and there are an estimated 2,255 homeless people in the city. Divided evenly, that’s $27,804 per homeless person.
But a large chunk of the $62.7 million is going toward programs to prevent homelessness and toward affordable housing, not directly to people experiencing homelessness.
Abbott's claim needs more context. We rate this claim Half True.

2,"""Most people below $50,000 don’t pay any income tax. The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%.""","on Thursday, October 17th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/17/rand-paul/fact-checking-rand-pauls-appearance-view/,Mostly True,Rand Paul,"Rand Paul’s claim about taxes went over poorly on The View, but it was pretty accurate","Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., drew a backlash from the audience of ABC’s ""The View"" when he argued that lower-income Americans get off pretty easy under the U.S. tax system.
Richer Americans, he said, carry most of the freight.
""We’ve taken the poor off of the rolls. They don’t pay income tax any more. Most people below $50,000 don’t pay any income tax,"" Paul said during the Oct. 11 episode. ""The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%.""
At that point, the audience began to object, and cohost Sunny Hostin told Paul, ""Our audience says that’s not true.""
But Paul doubled down. ""The IRS statistics say the top 1% in our country pay 40% of the income tax,"" he said.

We looked into it and found the senator was largely correct.
Paul’s evidence
When we reached out to Paul’s office, they said he was referring to the most recent projections for 2019 by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official arbiter of tax analysis for Congress. 
For the federal income tax, the committee found that every income group below $50,000 paid a negative average share of the income burden. That means that, on the whole, families in these income groups got deductions and credits that reduced their federal income tax liability below zero.
Meanwhile, the same analysis provided a snapshot of the tax burden shouldered by the top 1.2 percent of tax filers, those earning at least $500,000. This elite group collectively footed 51.5% of the nation’s individual income tax bill. That’s a larger share than what Paul said.
So if you look at the federal income tax, Paul’s comment on the view is on target.
What about other taxes?
Individual taxes aren’t the only ones Americans pay. 
If you factor in other federal taxes, including payroll and excise taxes, the numbers change.
The same Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found that those earning less than $50,000 paid 4.3% of all federal taxes. That’s still a relatively light burden, since these taxpayers earned 13% of all income generated.
As for Americans earning more than $500,000, their share of the tax burden declines to 30.7% once you add in these other federal taxes.
Other analyses back him up
A few other analyses are broadly in line with the joint committee’s data and what Paul said.
An annual analysis by the IRS found that in 2017, the top 1% paid 38.5% of federal income taxes. And taxpayers earning under $50,000 paid 5.98 percent of income taxes. (Not nothing, as Paul said, but not nearly as much.)
Meanwhile, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the breakdown for all federal taxes in 2019.
The center found that those earning up to about $50,000 in income collectively paid about 4.2% of all federal taxes, while the top 1% paid about 27 percent of all federal taxes.
These are averages, and individual tax burdens can vary.
""The results depend on the specific situations faced by taxpayers, such as whether or not they have children,"" said Mark Mazur, the Tax Policy Center’s director.
Our ruling
Paul said that ""most people below $50,000 don’t pay any income tax. The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%.""
Because he limited his comments to the federal income tax, Paul’s numbers are broadly accurate, and they even underplay the tax burden on the top 1%.
The picture shifts once you include other types of federal taxation. Those below $50,000 still pay a small share of the full federal tax burden, but the share paid by the top 1% falls to about 30%.
So Paul’s statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True."

Telling reporters that Erdogan would be meeting in Turkey the next day with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as American officials continue to press Turkey for a ceasefire, Trump said:
""We have a lot of great people over there; we'll see. In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way, as they shouldn't be as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now. But the Kurds know how to fight.""
After saying ""they’re not angels,"" Trump added: ""Syria is protecting the Kurds.""
The White House and his campaign did not respond to our requests for information to support his claim.
But while it is true that the Kurds have forged a new alliance with Syria, that occurred only because the U.S. withdrawal from the region that Trump ordered opened the door to Turkey's attacks on the Kurds.
""This statement is totally disconnected from reality given the long-standing, deep and intensely abiding enmity between Turkey and the Kurds and the entire purpose of the Turkish military offensive, which is to forcibly clear the border of Kurds and Kurdish forces,"" Bruce Hoffman, senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, told PolitiFact.
Kurds targeted
Here’s a timeline of recent events:
Oct. 5  — Turkey threatens incursion: Erdogan announces the completion of preparations for a military incursion into northeast Syria.
Oct. 6  — Trump announces withdrawal: Trump announces after a call with Erdogan that the United States would withdraw from the ""immediate area"" into which Turkish troops were expected to advance. The White House denies that Trump offered Turkey a ""green light"" to slaughter U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
Oct. 7  — Kurds fear massacre: Kurdish leaders condemn Trump’s decision ""to allow Turkish forces to invade Northeast Syria,"" saying: ""The Turkish military has been occupying the predominantly-Kurdish city of Afrin, Syria, since early 2018. Their military and militias have committed grave atrocities and human rights abuses there. We do not want a repeat of the invasion and occupation of Afrin.""
Oct. 9  — Turkish incursion begins: Turkish forces begin a ground offensive under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling. 
Oct. 10  — 150 Kurds killed: Turkey announces it has killed 150 Kurdish fighters.
Oct. 12  — Nearly 200,000 displaced: The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in northeastern Syria says that 191,069 people have been displaced as a result of Turkish military operations.
Oct. 13  — Kurds embrace Syria: The Kurdish fighters announce a new alliance with the government of Syria.
Oct. 16  — Kurds further threatened: Erdogan calls for Kurdish fighters battling his troops in northeastern Syria to lay down their weapons and withdraw from the border area ""this very night."" Erdogan also requests international support for his country’s battle against Kurdish fighters, whom he considers terrorists, and says Turkey would not stop fighting until it had established a planned ""safe zone"" in Syria roughly 20 miles deep.
Not safer without US
Missouri State University Kurdish expert and history professor Djene Rhys Bajalan said the Kurds’ new agreement with Syria’s Assad regime, which is backed by Russia, limits the areas under attack by Turkish forces. 
But the Syrian government ""does not have a strong record on respecting Kurdish rights and the dire military position means they will have very little leverage in negotiations to maintain the autonomy of northeastern Syria,"" he said.
And ""compared with the situation prior to the U.S. pullout, the Kurds certainly are not safer.""
Will Todman, associate fellow in the Middle East program and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, offered a similar view.
""It is certainly true that the Kurds were in great danger after the U.S. withdrawal and before forming an agreement with the regime, which the Russians mediated. Now that Russia is acting as their security guarantor, their position is more secure and they are better able to repel the Turkish-led offensive,"" Todman said. 
""But the Kurds are certainly not safer under the control of the Assad regime and Russia in comparison to when the United States had a presence. Regime forces are overstretched, there is significant local opposition to the return of regime forces which has led to unrest, and ISIS has already seized on the situation to conduct new attacks in the area.""
Another Missouri State expert on Kurdish politics, political scientist David Romano, was more emphatic.
The Kurds ""have not faced such an existential threat ever before,"" Romano told PolitiFact. ""They remain at risk of ethnic cleansing and genocide by Turkey.""
Our ruling
Trump said: ""The Kurds are much safer right now.""
In the days since Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Syrian border with Turkey, Turkey has attacked the area, killing scores of Kurds and displacing thousands more. And the Turkish president, who views the Kurds as terrorists, has vowed not to heed calls for a ceasefire.
We rate Trump’s statement False."
2,"""People haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.""","on Wednesday, October 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/california/statements/2019/oct/16/tom-steyer/tom-steyers-half-true-claim-90-americans-have-not-/,Half-True,Tom Steyer,Tom Steyer claimed ‘90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.’ Is he right? | PolitiFact Californ,"San Francisco hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is perhaps best known for his TV ads calling for President Trump’s impeachment. 
At his first debate appearance as a Democratic presidential candidate last night in Ohio, Steyer repeated his call to remove what he termed ""the criminal in the White House."" 
But he also railed against income inequality, leading fellow Democratic contender Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar to quip: ""... no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.""
Steyer’s claim that caught our attention was that the vast majority of Americans haven’t received a raise for decades.
""I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations,"" Steyer promised. ""But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.""
Was his claim about raises accurate? We set out on a fact check. 
PolitiFact’s analysis
We turned to PolitiFact’s analysis in April of a similar claim made by Democratic presidential contender and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. We’ll place a rating on Steyer’s claim based on what PolitiFact found. 
""Since 1973, the income of the bottom 90 percent, so pretty much all of us, didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit,"" Buttigieg claimed. 
PolitiFact investigated whether income levels for most people -- adjusted for inflation, which economists consider a necessity for such comparisons -- haven’t increased since 1973. It found that ""income levels have actually risen beyond inflation during that period,"" but the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent hews pretty closely to what Buttigieg said. 
It rated the mayor’s claim Half True, meaning it is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
CBO data shows income growth
In its fact check, PolitiFact reviewed data from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, covering 1979 to 2015, most of the period in question.
The figures CBO used were adjusted for inflation and federal taxes, but not for state and local taxes. They showed income growth for people in four different economic ranges: the lowest 20 percent of the income distribution, the middle 60 percent, the 81st percentile to the 99th percentile, and the top 1 percent. They didn’t mirror Buttigieg’s precise parameters, but economists said they are useful for showing whether the mayor was broadly right or not, PolitiFact reported. 
Here’s a chart showing the CBO data:

The top 1 percent, in red, has the most unique and most impressive growth. The other income groups show positive but much slower growth, after adjusting for inflation.
This undercuts Buttigieg’s assertion that for most people, income ""didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit,"" since the 1970s, PolitiFact said. 
Other data supports the claims by Buttigieg and Steyer.
Inflation-adjusted figures from the Economic Policy Institute, for example, show clear wage stagnation for the bottom 60 percent of the income scale. The rate did go up for the 70 and 80 percent levels, which means the 90 percent figure would be a bit exaggerated.
PolitiFact also cited the World Inequality Database. It shows the bottom 50 percent and the next 40 percent -- essentially the 90 percent that Buttigieg cited -- have taken declining shares of the nation’s income since 1973. By contrast, both the top 10 percent and the top 1 percent have seen their shares grow.
When we asked Steyer’s campaign for evidence supporting his claim, it pointed to an August report by the Pew Research Center. It found today’s real average wage, defined as the wage after accounting for inflation, has ""had some ups and downs,"" but ""has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers.""
Our ruling
Tom Steyer claimed at the Democratic presidential debate in Ohio that, ""People haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.""
PolitiFact in April fact-checked a similar claim by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg: ""Since 1973, the income of the bottom 90 percent, so pretty much all of us, didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit.""
It found that income for every group, as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, has actually increased beyond the rate of inflation since the 1970s. However, another measurement -- the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent -- has indeed declined since 1973. It rated the mayor’s claim Half True. 
We agreed with PolitiFact’s assessment and rated Steyer’s claim Half True, as well.

A Facebook post, shared on Oct. 12, claims that for the two weeks after you receive a flu shot you’re an ""active, live walking virus:""
""Folks who get flu shots please have some respect and courtesy and stay home for minimal [sic] of 2 weeks while you are an active live walking virus. Also don’t hug others and give kisses and please immediately tell others you were vaccinated so they don’t come close to you.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This is a common myth. So common, in fact, that a 2015 study published in Vaccine found that 43% of the public believed that getting the flu vaccine can give you the flu. 
But the shot does not contain an active virus and an inactivated virus cannot transmit infection.
The myth is at the top of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s ""Misconceptions about Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines"" list. The organization says:
""No, flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu viruses that have been ‘inactivated’ (killed) and that therefore are not infectious, or b) using only a single gene from a flu virus (as opposed to the full virus) in order to produce an immune response without causing infection. This is the case for recombinant influenza vaccines.""
Another CDC flu fact sheet also notes that while the nasal spray flu vaccine does contain a live virus, ""the viruses are changed so that they cannot give you the flu."" (More about this ""change"" below.)
Harvard Medical School tackled the superstition in a breakdown of flu myths and says that since it takes around two weeks to get protection from the vaccine, people who get sick before then wrongly assume the shot gave them the flu.
""The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus that can't transmit infection. So people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the flu shot caused their illness.""
William Schaffner, a professor and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, also confirmed to PolitiFact that the claim is a myth.
""The injectable flu vaccine is composed of selected parts of the influenza virus and cannot re-assemble itself into the complete virus in the human body. Thus, it is impossible for the flu vaccine to cause influenza,"" Schaffner wrote in an email. ""The nasal spray influenza vaccine is a ‘tamed’ flu virus. It can multiply in the nose where it stimulates the body to provide protection, but it is biologically incapable of multiplying down in the lungs or anywhere else in the body. It also cannot cause the person who has received the vaccine to experience influenza.""
Besides contracting the flu within the window before the vaccine takes effect, people may also experience other side effects such as pain, redness or swelling near the injection site; headache, fever, nausea and sore muscles.
""After receiving the injectable vaccine everyone experiences a sore arm for a few hours. In very few persons this can last a day. Some also have a bit of swelling or redness at the injection site,"" Schaffner wrote. ""Only 1% - 2% of persons experience a slight fever that can last a day or so. The nasal spray vaccine can be associated with a runny nose or a scratchy throat for a day or two. These brief symptoms are just minor reactions to the vaccine.""
The only viral thing about this claim is the claim itself. We rate it Pants on Fire!"
2,"Says about universal basic income, ""Thomas Paine was for it at our founding ... Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans… It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.""","on Wednesday, October 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/16/andrew-yang/fact-checking-andrew-yang-history-universal-basic-/,Mostly True,Andrew Yang,-checking Andrew Yang on history of universal basic income,"Giving every American adult $1,000 a month may sound like a gimmick or too good to be true, but Andrew Yang says it’s a ""deeply American idea"" dating back centuries.
""Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen’s dividend. Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968,"" Yang told Iowa voters on Sept. 21. ""A thousand economists endorsed it. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.""
Yang, an entrepreneur seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has made similar claims on Twitter and while debating fellow Democrats.
Yang’s Freedom Dividend plan is a form of universal basic income, guaranteeing $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen over 18 years old, without having to pass a test or meet a work requirement.
PolitiFact decided to look into the history of universal basic income, particularly Yang’s reference to Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 1970s legislation. We found that his comparisons are broadly correct, but not precise.
RELATED: Andrew Yang’s universal basic income proposal, explained
""Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen’s dividend.""
Paine wrote that Earth in its ""natural uncultivated state"" was the common property of the human race. He believed that cultivation and private land ownership deprived non-landowners of their ""natural inheritance."" 
Paine suggested a national fund to compensate individuals for that loss, whether they were rich or poor. He proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and that every person aged 50, and all others who arrived at that age, be paid 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives.
Paine’s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and has an element of universal basic income, said Harvey J. Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. But it wasn’t the same thing.
Also, Paine’s plan wasn't published at the founding of the United States in 1776 but about two decades later, inspired by the French Revolution, said Gary Berton, coordinator for the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College and secretary of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Paine also never used the term ""citizen's dividend"" in relation to his proposal (he called it ""the plan""), Berton said.
""Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968.""
It is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?"" But he wasn’t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed.
King wrote that past approaches to fighting poverty (particularly housing programs, education, and family counseling) were not coordinated, developed at different rates, and were indirect approaches to solving poverty. 
""I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,"" King wrote.
Yang is on solid footing in claiming that King sought a form of guaranteed income, even if King is not well known for that position, said Doug E. Thompson, a history professor and director of the Spencer B. King Jr. Center for Southern Studies at Mercer University.           
King was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. He was there to prepare for a march on behalf of sanitation workers who were striking and advocating for better working conditions and better pay. King saw the strike as a good way to highlight the need for his Poor People’s Campaign, Thompson said.
""Guaranteed income was not on the table in Memphis as much as the plight of folks who worked hard in the U.S. but could not overcome the wealth gaps that kept poor people in cycles of poverty,"" Thompson said. ""It would have been an outgrowth of Memphis, but not its central focus.""
""It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.""
The House in 1970 and 1971 passed bills that ""were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income,"" said Brian Steensland, professor and chair of sociology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. 
The New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon’s revision of the welfare system, establishing ""for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working."" The proposal included a work requirement. In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income.
While there was wide interest in the 1960s and early 1970s for a ""guaranteed annual income,"" the specifics of what the term meant, the proposals, and related discourse changed over time.
""Nixon’s plan was more ‘conservative’ than many of the available guaranteed annual income plans at the time, and his rhetoric was more conservative than the plans themselves,"" Steensland said. ""His rhetoric was very work-oriented. Nixon constantly referenced moving people from the ‘welfare rolls’ to the ‘payrolls,’ though in fact many of the recipients would have received income from both sources.""
Another key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients’ income level. Universal basic income proposals, like Yang’s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make.
Our ruling
Yang said about universal basic income, ""Thomas Paine was for it at our founding.... Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans… It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.""
Paine supported a one-time payment to all individuals when they reached 21 and a version of today’s Social Security program. King advocated for a guaranteed minimum income. The House passed something close to universal basic income once in 1970 and once in 1971, not twice in 1971.

Kennedy as saying ""If the United States ever experienced [a coup to overthrow the government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.""","on Wednesday, October 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/16/facebook-posts/no-evidence-jfk-said-any-us-coup-would-come-cia-no/,False,Facebook posts,No evidence JFK said any US coup would ‘come from the CIA not the Pentagon’ | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Did President John F. Kennedy really say that if the United States ever experienced a coup it would come from the CIA? 
That’s what one Facebook post claims. The post features a photo of President Kennedy with text alongside that reads:
""If the United States ever experienced [a coup to overthrow the government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.’ JFK""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The internet often attributes this statement to Kennedy, but there is no evidence that he said or wrote it.
We see the quote widely linked to Kennedy in unsourced social media posts. But we could not locate any variation of the statement in several searches of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation website.
Researchers at the JFK Presidential Library told PolitiFact they haven’t come across the quote in Kennedy’s papers or addresses, either.
""We've never found any evidence in the archives here that John F. Kennedy said or wrote this statement,"" Stacey Chandler, a reference archivist with the library, wrote in an email. ""We do, however, have archival evidence that the article that featured the quotation was the subject of some concern in the administration, based on a National Security Council meeting about Vietnam that took place the same day the article was published.""
Chandler pointed us to an Oct. 2, 1963, article by Scripps-Howard staff writer Richard Starnes, who was reporting from Saigon, Vietnam, at the time. 
The article, ""‘Arrogant’ CIA Disobeys Orders in Viet Nam,"" was published in the Washington Daily News. The following passage appears about halfway through the article:
""Other American agencies here are incredibly bitter about the CIA. 'If the United States ever experiences a 'Seven Days in May' it will come from the CIA, and not the Pentagon,' one U.S. official commented caustically.""
""Seven Days in May"" is a fictional book, published in 1962, of a military attempt to overthrow the U.S. government.
Starnes adds later in the article that a ""very high American official here, a man who has spent much of his life in the service of democracy, likened the CIA's growth to a malignancy, and added he was not sure even the White House could control it any longer.""
But he doesn’t name that official and indicates that several anonymous sources provided quotes like that of the ""U.S. official"" to whom the coup comment is attributed. 
A New York Times article about Starnes’ report was published the following day. In it, reporter Arthur Krock wrote about Starnes’ article and combines some of the quotes into one paragraph: 
""Among the views attributed to United States officials on the scene, including one described as a 'very high American official...who has spent much of his life in service of democracy...are the following: The CIA's growth was 'likened to a malignancy; which the 'very high official was not sure even the White House could control...any longer.' 'If the United States ever experiences [an attempt at a coup to overthrow the Government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.' The agency 'represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.'""
This passage puts the ""very high American official"" in close proximity to the quotation in question, and may be the reason people started to attach the words to Kennedy. 
""In the archives here, we do have evidence that John F. Kennedy was aware of the Starnes piece,"" Chandler said. She said Kennedy mentioned it in the Oct. 2, 1963, National Security Council meeting, according to the meeting summary (located on page 27 of the scanned document here):
""The President then asked what we should say about the news story attacking CIA which appeared in today's Washington Daily News. He read a draft paragraph for inclusion in the public statement but rejected it as being too fluffy. He felt no one would believe a statement saying that there were no differences of view among the various US agencies represented in Saigon. He thought that we should say now we had a positive policy endorsed by the National Security Council and that such policy would be carried out by all concerned.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims President John F. Kennedy once said ""If the United States ever experienced [a coup to overthrow the government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.""
But there is no evidence that proves JFK said the statement. A news article from October 1963 quoting an anonymous ""U.S. official"" appears to be the original source for the quotation. In the years since, people have assumed that person was Kennedy, but JFK scholars have not made that explicit leap.
We rate this False."

We’re not fact-checking Trump’s claim about the crowd size here but Minnesota Public Radio has looked at his boast. In short: the Target Center where Trump appeared can hold approximately 20,000 people, but a precise count of how many people were there is difficult. Even if more than 20,000 attendees were in the center that day, it’s not the first time — a basketball game and a U2 concert drew 20,412 and 20,200, respectively. 
As for those who didn’t make it inside the arena, Minnesota Public Radio reported that ""the president’s assertion that 25,000 were left on the outside is dubious given that an overflow space wasn’t full and reporters on the outside of the arena saw nothing nearing that number."" 
The accuracy of the photo, however, is easier to fact-check. It’s not showing the Trump crowd.
It’s not outside the Target Center, where the Minnesota Timberwolves play. It’s in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 22, 2016, during a victory parade after the Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA championship. Angelo Merendino shot the photo for Getty Images.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., explained her support for a ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care proposal with criticism of the U.S. tax system, saying it is too generous to the richest Americans. 
""Let these facts sink in: The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else,"" Omar tweeted Oct. 12. ""27 million Americans don’t have health insurance. We can address both issues by taxing the wealthy to fund #MedicareForAll. Let’s get it done when we get back to Washington.""
Let these facts sink in:-The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else.-27 million Americans don’t have health insurance.We can address both issues by taxing the wealthy to fund #MedicareForAll. Let’s get it done when we get back to Washington. https://t.co/T7PZ2SFAhR— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 12, 2019 
Omar is right about the number of uninsured Americans: The most recent annual report by the U.S. Census Bureau found that almost 27.5 million Americans lacked health insurance for all of 2018.
Here, we’ll take a closer look at her first assertion that ""the 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else."" We found that the reality is more complicated than Omar portrayed it.
A study says one thing, Omar said another
Several days earlier, Omar shared a New York Times article about ""The Triumph of Injustice,"" a new book by University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The book by Saez and Zucman offered a similar statistic — one that received significant media attention. 
The book argues that in 2018, the richest 400 households in the United States paid a lower effective tax rate than households in any other income range. Effective tax rates refer to taxes paid as a percentage of income earned. Due to tax breaks and other factors, effective tax rates are usually lower than the statutory tax rates for a given income level. 
Some critics have questioned the Saez-Zucman methodology, saying it exaggerates the amount of taxes paid by lower-income Americans. That’s because their analysis excluded refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, even though both are administered through the tax code. 
Failing to account for these tax refunds artificially shows higher tax payments for the lower-income households that take advantage of these credits, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.
That’s important context, but there’s something else to know for this fact-check: The statement Omar tweeted is not identical to the widely publicized finding of the Saez-Zucman book. 
First, their finding didn’t address the top 1% of households — it addressed the top 400 households in the country. That’s not a minor switch: The most recent IRS figures show that 1.4 million households belonged to the top 1%. That’s a universe more than 3,500 times larger than the top 400 households.
Second, Omar’s tweet said the top 1% paid ""less in taxes"" than everyone else, which can be read to mean a dollar amount. However, the Saez-Zucman research addressed effective tax rates, which is the percentage of income paid in taxes, not the overall amount paid.
How much does the 1% actually pay?
By other measures, however, Omar has a stronger point that the richest 1% of Americans pay less in taxes than the rest of the country.
Tax Policy Center estimates for 2019 show the top 1% paid 27% of all federal taxes, compared with 73% of taxes paid by the bottom 99%. 
Meanwhile, the total amount of tax dollars paid by the top 1% ($828 billion) was exceeded by the amount paid by the bottom 99% ($2.27 trillion).
(Note: The center’s baseline data account for all types of federal taxes, including individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, the estate tax, and excise taxes, but it excludes state and local taxes.)
""The congresswoman's statement was accurate —– the richest 1% of Americans pay less in overall taxes than everyone else, no matter how you slice the data,"" said Jeremy Slevin, a spokesman for Omar. ""And while the federal tax system is more progressive, when you factor in state and local taxes, it paints a much more regressive picture of the taxes Americans pay."" 
Still, it’s not too surprising that a group 99 times as large would collectively pay more in taxes. Omar’s decision to focus on this point obscures some key context: The 1% still pays a disproportionate share of the federal tax bill.
How do we know this? This data shows that 1% of the U.S. tax-paying population earns 16.1% of the nation’s pre-tax income. But it pays 27% of the tax burden.
You can argue that the richest Americans should pay even more than 27% of the nation’s taxes; either way, it’s clear that the current tax system requires that a small but wealthy fraction of Americans shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden.
Our ruling
Omar tweeted, ""The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else.""
The bottom 99% pay more in tax dollars and shoulder a larger percentage of the tax burden than the top 1%. However, focusing on this calculation ignores a contrary piece of the picture: the top 1% continues to pay a larger share of all federal taxes than it collects in income.
We rate the statement Half True."
2,"""Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.""","on Wednesday, October 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/16/julian-castro/julian-castro-wrong-about-job-losses-ohio-michigan/,False,Julián Castro,"Julian Castro wrong about job losses in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvan","During the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, Julian Castro took a shot at President Donald Trump’s stewardship of the economy — especially in three key Midwestern states Trump won in 2016.
""All of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises,"" Castro said, ""because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.""
Castro’s campaign got back to us with an explanation, but it relies on an atypical reading of the numbers to achieve its effect.
Here’s what we found when we looked at the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers in the simplest, most traditional fashion.
The latest official release state-by-state employment trends is current through August 2019. Here’s what you get if you compare the August 2019 figures to the July 2019 figures:
Ohio: A gain of 3,700 jobs.
Michigan: A gain of 6,100 jobs
Pennsylvania: A gain of 16,500 jobs.
So how does Castro support his claim of job losses in those states?
His campaign told PolitiFact that he compared March figures with July figures, showing that employment dropped in Ohio by 7,300, in Michigan by 11,500, and in Pennsylvania by 4,500.
Note that Castro used July, rather than August, even though August numbers are available. He argued that July is a better measurement because the August numbers will be revised before being made official.
The August numbers will indeed be revised — here’s a primer on employment data revisions we put together recently — but it’s not a common practice to simply wave away the most recent figures because they will eventually be revised. All employment numbers are eventually revised, yet economists regularly study the most recent ones, politicians talk about them, and the media covers them.
More to the point, Castro didn’t provide any indication in his statement that he was using a non-standard comparison. What his figures amount to are a cherry-picked month-to-month quirk that paints a misleading picture of the job trends in each of these states.
For instance, here’s the change for the full-year period between August 2018 and August 2019:
Ohio: A gain of 24,800 jobs.
Michigan: A gain of 16,000 jobs
Pennsylvania: A gain of 38,400 jobs.
And here are the employment trends since Trump took office in 2016, using BLS data collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Each state has seen its employment levels rise.
Here’s Ohio:

Here’s Michigan:

And here’s Pennsylvania:

Our ruling
Castro said, ""Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs.""
Official government figures show that each state gained jobs between July 2019 and August 2019, the latest month-over-month period available. To arrive at his job-loss figure, Castro cherry-picked a time period that he didn’t mention in his remarks — a time period that ignores the existence of the most current data.
His assertion that employment levels have been crumbling in these states is belied by data showing that each state has seen job gains both in the past year and since Trump took office.
We rate the statement False."
2,"""For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes"" for Medicare for All.","on Wednesday, October 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/health-check/statements/2019/oct/16/joe-biden/bidens-claim-medicare-all-tax-hikes-rests-flaky-an/,Mostly False,Joe Biden,Joe Biden’s claim on Medicare For All tax hikes rests on flaky analysis | PolitiFact Health Check,"Sparring over ""Medicare for All"" and universal health care, Vice President Joe Biden leaned on a new variation of attack line, highlighting potential costs to middle-class Americans.
""For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes,"" Biden said at the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate.
We’ve heard many debates over what Medicare for All could ultimately cost, but these specific figures were new to us. And the health plan — pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and backed as well by Sen. Elizabeth Warren — leaves many details yet to be colored in.
We were curious where these figures came from, and how they could be derived. So we decided to dig in.
The numbers
We contacted the Biden campaign, which told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax — financing mechanisms they said have been proposed by Sanders.
When you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised.
But this math is problematic on many levels.
For one thing, Sanders’ bill doesn’t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn’t include any financing mechanism at all.
In a separate document, Sanders talks about different ways to pay for the system — and those are listed as two examples of pay-fors. But they aren’t the only ones, and Sanders frames this list as ""a number of options to begin [the] discussion.""
So suggesting that Medicare for All would increase taxes as specifically as Biden suggests is an inaccurate reflection of the bill.
Another issue is that there isn’t a good sense of what this health plan would cost, so any estimate of its tax burden is really just a guess.
""There are so many unknowns that you cannot say anything definitive,"" said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University.
Biden’s statement ""could be true,"" he added — but ""there’s no evidence either way.""
Taxes versus costs
And there’s another issue, said Ellen Meara, a health economist at Dartmouth College. That is, highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading, she argued.
Meara pointed to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that the average employer-sponsored plan for a family of four costs $20,000 per in premiums. That, economists say, results in lower wages for employees. Many argue that if employers were relieved of this cost, that would translate into people earning significantly more in take-home pay.
""A $5,000 or $6,000 tax is really quite small compared with what middle-class families forego in cash wages to get employer-sponsored coverage,"" Meara said.
Our ruling
Biden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how Medicare for all would affect families making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year.
Those numbers don’t come out of thin air, but they are based on too many assumptions to be reliable. And they don’t accurately reflect what we know about what this plan would cost, or the extent to which it proposes specific new taxes.
This claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and assumes more than the evidence warrants. We rate it Mostly False."
2,"""Back when I was studying it, two out of three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance.""","on Tuesday, October 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/health-check/statements/2019/oct/16/elizabeth-warren/warren-wades-debate-health-care-costs-and-bankrupt/,Mostly True,Elizabeth Warren,Elizabeth Warren wades into debate on health care costs and bankruptcy | PolitiFact Health Check,"In a back-and-forth about Medicare for All and the cost of health care, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., directed the discussion back to medical debt and bankruptcy — citing her own work from Harvard Law School.
""Back when I was studying it, two out of three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance,"" Warren said.
This is a new emphasis in the ongoing debate over health care costs, and the debate over what role health care plays in American finances. Instead of focusing on uninsurance, Warren stepped into whether the insurance people currently have is sufficient.
But much of the research around medical debt and bankruptcy is controversial — especially Warren’s own work. 
We decided to take a deeper look.
What the research says
Warren’s campaign directed us to research published in 2009 in the American Journal of Medicine. Co-authored by Warren, it looks at a random sample of 2,314 bankruptcy filers from 2007. 
The paper examined what debtors reported as their cause of bankruptcy. Warren is referring here to people who either cited significant direct medical debt, remortgaging a home to pay medical debt, or lost income due to illness.
In that category, more than two-thirds of families had health insurance — in fact, three-quarters did. 
So from that simple standpoint, the number checks out.
The controversy
But it isn’t necessarily that simple. This specific paper has long been the subject of controversy. In part, it’s because it focuses on people who have declared bankruptcy, rather than looking at the financial impact of medical debt at large.
Scholars are also quick to note that, in the majority of so-called ""medical bankruptcies"" identified in the paper, the issue wasn’t debts incurred to pay off health care bills. Rather, the bigger problem was foregone income because people couldn’t work.
That’s fueled a lengthy back-and-forth, in particular over whether this paper is actually useful in determining what role medical debt plays in fueling bankruptcies.
But its impact on this specific claim isn’t so clear. That’s because Warren narrowed her statement, and focused on something less disputable. 
For one thing, the paper is clear in finding that two-thirds of families — in fact, more than that — experienced bankruptcy after a medical problem despite having health insurance. 
That finding was ""the headline of the study,"" said Paul Ginsburg, a health economist and professor at the University of Southern California. (Ginsburg also noted the importance of foregone income in driving bankruptcies, rather than medical costs.)
And Warren qualified it further during the debate, by limiting this statistic to what was found ""back when [she] was studying it"" — making it a less sweeping claim.
What’s more suspect is whether this finding — even if accurate — supports her next point: that the cost of health care is what’s driving people’s financial problems, and that a generous single-payer plan would ameliorate this issue. 
For instance, ""You cannot go from that result to a conclusion that we need Medicare For All,"" Ginsburg said. 
Health insurance is more generous today than it was when Warren studied it, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And insuring everyone — even as generously as Medicare For All suggests — wouldn’t necessarily address the issue of foregone income when people are sick, which the research suggests is a bigger financial concern.
Our ruling
Warren’s claim comes from a paper that is controversial, and whose methods and interpretation have been called into question. That said, this statistic is fairly specific, and her wording in the claim precise. In itself, it’s a fair reflection of what the paper says.
Where caution is more important: Warren says this finding suggests the cost of health care is what’s causing Americans financial harm. That isn’t necessarily borne out, and requires more scrutiny.
This statement is accurate but would benefit from more information. We rate it Mostly True."
2,"Americans ""say that what they want is a choice"" to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance.","on Tuesday, October 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/16/pete-buttigieg/refereeing-pete-buttigieg-elizabeth-warren-medicar/,True,Pete Buttigieg,"Refereeing Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren on public support for Medicare for A","Pete Buttigieg sparred with Elizabeth Warren at the most recent Democratic debate over how to expand health insurance coverage for all Americans.
Buttigieg said he favors allowing Americans younger than 65 to enroll in Medicare if they wish. Warren, by contrast, prefers to transition all Americans from their current insurance plan to government coverage.
""Elizabeth supports Medicare for All, which would provide all Americans with a public health care program,"" her website says.
Here’s what Buttigieg said at the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio:
""I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. The choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It’s just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not. And I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans.""
Is Buttigieg correct to say that Americans prefer giving people under 65 an option to join Medicare as opposed to requiring them to give up their current coverage?
As we seek to answer this question, we’ll begin by noting that terminology and question wording matters a lot when pollsters ask Americans for their preferences. 
Looking at the recent polls on health policy reveals a wide variation in how questions are worded making many of them not useful for refereeing the Buttigieg-Warren exchange.
However, we did find two polls from 2019 that are on point — and both of them support Buttigieg’s position.
An NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll conducted in mid July asked, ""Do you think Medicare for All – that is, a national health insurance program for all Americans that replaces private health insurance – is a good idea or a bad idea?"" This is essentially the Warren approach.
On that question, 41% of respondents thought that was a good idea, but a larger percentage – 54% – said it was a bad idea. 
A second question by NPR/PBS/Marist asked respondents about an approach more in line with Buttigieg’s idea.
The survey asked, ""Do you think Medicare for all that want it – that is, allow all Americans to choose between a national health insurance program or their own private health insurance – is a good idea or a bad idea?""
That proposal earned a strong thumbs-up from respondents: 70% said it was a good idea, with only 25% saying it was a bad idea.
A second poll – conducted by Kaiser in January 2019 – found stronger support for the Buttigieg approach than for the Warren approach.
The survey asked, ""Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-All, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan"" – essentially the Warren approach.
For this question, a majority did favor it – 56% support compared to 42% opposition.
But support was even stronger for the Buttigieg approach. The survey asked, ""Do you favor or oppose creating a national government administered health plan similar to Medicare that would be open to anyone, but would allow people to keep the coverage they have if they prefer?""
This drew support from 74% of respondents and opposition from only 24%.
A third option with a slightly different wording fared even better in Kaiser’s polling. ""Do you favor or oppose allowing people between the ages of 50 and 64 to buy insurance through the Medicare program?""
This won the support of 77% of respondents, compared to only 18% opposition. Support was strong across all parties: It won 85% support from Democrats, 75% support from Independents, and 69% from Republicans.
Kaiser’s most recent polling, released the same day as the debate, shows a steady rise in support for the Buttigieg approach – from 65% in July to 73% in October – and a steady decline for Warren’s approach – from 56% in January to 51% in October.
Our ruling
Buttigieg said that Americans ""say that what they want is a choice"" to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance.
Polling on this question shows higher levels of support for an opt-in approach to expanding Medicare than for a required switch away from private insurance. We rate the statement True."
2,"""If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks.""","on Tuesday, October 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/15/elizabeth-warren/phony-facebook-ad-warren-said-most-tv-networks-wil/,Mostly False,Elizabeth Warren,"In phony Facebook ad, Warren said most TV networks will refuse ads with a 'lie' but that’s wrong","Sen. Elizabeth Warren escalated her battle to break up Facebook by posting an ad that intentionally included a false account about Mark Zuckerberg backing President Donald Trump.
Warren’s goal was to show that the social media giant allows misinformation by Trump.
""Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,"" the Oct. 10 ad began. ""You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, ""how could this possibly be true?""
The ad then pivoted to a disclaimer — no, the Facebook CEO did not endorse Trump — before attacking Facebook: ""What Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform –-- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters. If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.""
Warren’s post followed an unsuccessful push by the Joe Biden campaign to get Facebook to reject a Trump campaign ad about Biden’s role in the firing of a prosecutor in Ukraine. PolitiFact rated a statement in a similar Trump ad False. Facebook denied Biden’s request.
We decided to fact-check Warren’s claim that unlike Facebook, most TV networks will refuse to air a political campaign ad that contains falsehoods. 
While the Warren campaign cited a half dozen examples in recent years of TV networks or stations rejecting ads, we found that broadcast networks are generally required to run candidate ads under federal law. The same law doesn’t apply to cable networks or to PAC ads. 
Facebook’s policy on ads
Facebook does have a partnership with third-party fact-checkers -- including PolitiFact -- to debunk viral hoaxes and demote that content. But Facebook exempts politicians from the fact-checking program, stating that it won’t ""referee political debates"" or block a politician’s speech from an audience.
While Facebook drew attention for an announcement in September about exempting political candidates, that had already been Facebook’s policy since 2017.
Christopher Terry, a University of Minnesota professor of communications and expert on political advertising, said that because Facebook is a private unregulated platform, it can do what it wants.
""Because Facebook is its own playground, it gets to make its own rules,"" he said.
Facebook has set rules about transparency to show who paid for ads. But it doesn’t restrict political content. 
Federal rules for television
There are rules, however, for television.
Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 states:
""If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provision of this section.""
It also specifically says licensees can’t censor ""material broadcast by any such candidate."" 
Broadcasters are bound by that act and therefore can’t reject a presidential candidate’s ad, even if contains false information. (The candidates do have to abide by disclosure rules to make it clear who paid for the ad.)
Every election season, some candidates argue that they have been unfairly attacked and that broadcasters should take down ads, wrote David Oxenford, a lawyer who has represented broadcasters for decades and is a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP.
However, ""broadcasters can’t censor a candidate ad, so they can’t reject it (or remove it from the air) no matter what its content is,"" Oxenford wrote.
There are caveats.The law does not apply to PACs or independent expenditure ads. And, importantly, the rules for political ads have been interpreted not to apply to cable networks such as CNN. The rules do apply to local cable operators. 
Cable networks somewhat subscribe to the idea in the act that they won’t censor content, but they aren’t bound by it, Terry said. 
CNN rejected an ad about Biden and the Ukraine prosecutor. The ad mentioned ""media lapdogs"" for the Democrats as it showed footage of CNN stars. 
The ad disparages CNN and ""makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets,"" a CNN spokesperson told PolitiFact.
That ad was one of a handful of ads the Warren campaign cited as examples of political ads TV or radio rejected in recent years. Multiple stations and Facebook ultimately rejected a Trump ad about a migrant caravan in 2018 that critics said was racist. 
We sent Warren’s examples to Terry, the University of Minnesota professor. He said that Warren’s examples included issue ads, which aren’t covered by the rule.
""It’s only the campaign ads that are protected from the no-censorship provision,"" he said.
The Warren campaign also cited an FCC website page that states broadcasters should ""act with reasonable care to ensure that advertisements aired on their stations are not false or misleading."" However, it’s the FCC law that bans censorship that truly carries weight.
We also found that in May 2017, multiple networks refused to air a Trump ad about his first 100 days that had a ""fake news"" graphic superimposed over the photos of news anchors. It appeared networks rejected the ad by making a case that Trump didn’t yet meet the legal qualifications of a candidate more than three years before the election.
Our ruling
Warren said, ""If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks.""
This is a misreading of both federal and actual practice. Federal law requires broadcast networks to run political candidate ads without vetting them for lies or falsehoods. The same law does not apply to cable networks, but those networks also generally aim to run such ads, experts told us. 
Warren does have a point that federal law does not apply to online social networks such as Facebook, so Facebook can take candidate ads regardless of whether they include falsehoods.
But overall, it’s inaccurate to say that ""most networks"" will refuse to air an ad by Trump with a lie in it. We could find no evidence that most networks reject false candidate ads.
We rate this statement Mostly False."
3,On whether Gov. Ralph Northam should resign.,"on Tuesday, October 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/oct/15/ghazala-hashmi/ghazela-hashmi-u-turns-call-gov-northams-resignati/,Full Flop,Ghazala Hashmi,Ghazala Hashmi U-turns on call for Gov. Northam's resignation | PolitiFact Virgin,"Three times during a recent forum, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant accused Democratic challenger Ghazala Hashmi of caving in to Gov. Ralph Northam for a political donation.
""When Gov. Northam’s blackface-KKK scandal broke in February, I called on him to resign and Professor Hashmi called on him to resign,"" Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, said at the Oct. 9 event. ""But right after Professor Hashmi won her primary in June - a few weeks later - she accepted $25,000 from Gov. Northam and now is silent on the prior call for him to resign.""
""That is not the kind of leadership we need in the Virginia Senate,"" Sturtevant said, questioning Hashmi’s backbone be an ""independent voice and stand up to power and special interests.""
Hashmi’s reply: ""Gov. Northam is not on the ballot in November 2019. Glen is on the ballot and I’m on the ballot. And if we’re going to make decisions about who is right for this district...we need to be focusing on issues that concern this district.""
We checked Hashmi’s position on Northam’s resignation on the Flip-O-Meter, which rates a politician's consistency on an issue.
On Feb. 1, 2019, a photo emerged from Northam’s 1984 medical school yearbook page showing one person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe and hood. Northam initially apologized for being in the photo.
The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus called for Northam’s resignation that night and Hashmi followed suit. She tweeted, ""I share in @VaBlackCaucus feelings of betrayal and support this statement and their work representing people of color across the Commonwealth.""
Notham recanted the next day during a chaotic news conference, saying he wasn’t in the photo, recalling another incident decades ago when he did wear blackface to compete in a Michael Jackson dance contest, and vowing to remain in office.
The Black Caucus amplified its call for resignation, joined by a cascade of other Democratic office holders, including U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Northam has ""irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve,"" the caucus said in a written statement. ""Changing his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust.""
Hashmi tweeted that day, ""I stand in solidarity with the @VaBlackCaucus and call for @GovernorVA to resign.""
Hashmi won the June 11 Democratic primary for the 10th District senate seat. On June 18, she accepted a $25,000 donation from Northam’s PAC, The Way Ahead.
We asked Hashmi’s campaign if she has changed her mind on Northam and got a written statement from the candidate.
""I'm not calling upon the Governor to resign,"" she said. ""The governor has clearly stated his intention not to resign, and we know that we have critical legislative priorities in front of us. When I'm in the Senate, I look forward to working with the Governor on progressive legislation that we both want to see signed into law, such as ensuring that there are background checks on all gun sales, making sure our schools are better funded, and providing greater access to affordable health care for all Virginians.""
Hashmi is not the only person to change views of Northam. In February, after the blackface scandal, a Washington Post-Schar School poll found voters were split on Northam, with 43% approving of his job performance and 44% disapproving. Another Post poll at the end of September showed Northam’s standing had improved, with 47% approving of his performance, 29% disapproving. Only 28% regarded Northam as a ""very important"" issue this fall.
The Black Caucus quelled its call for Northam’s resignation after the governor made it clear he would stay on. Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico and caucus chairman, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in April that focusing on the scandal, ""is not the work that my constituents, or I don't think most citizens of the commonwealth, expect us to be spending our time on.""
At least three other Democrats who called for Northam’s resignation joined Hashmi in accepting money from the governor’s PAC, according to records from the Virginia Public Access Project. 
Sen. Rosalyn Dance of Petersburg, a black caucus member, received $10,000 on April 5 during her unsuccessful primary campaign. 
Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, called for Northam’s resignation on Feb. 2 and accepted a total $15,000 in donations from the PAC on May 21 and July 24. His opponent, Republican GayDonna Vandergriff, calls VanValkenburg's  actions ""two-faced.""
Larry Barnett, the Democratic challenger in the 27th House district in Chesterfield County, called for Northam’s departure on Feb. 2 and received a total $15,000 from the PAC on May 29 and July 16. His Republican opponent, Del. Roxann Robinson, calls him a ""hypocrite"" for doing so.
Our ruling
Hashmi called for Northam’s resignation twice in February, accepted $25,000 from his PAC in June, and now says ""I’m not calling on the governor to resign.""
Many have struggled with the blackface scandal. Hashmi is among lots of Democrats who called on Northam to quit and became accepting of his decision to stay. At least four of them, including Hashmi, took the governor’s campaign donations.
Hashmi has completely changed her position and we rate it a ""Full Flop."""

The parody tweet mixes together two stories.
We have previously fact-checked claims surrounding the 2015 agreement with Iran promoted by President Barack Obama. Called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal freed up frozen Iranian assets and lifted economic sanctions and included Iran and the United States as well as China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In return, Iran opened up to international inspections and dismantled key pieces of its nuclear program. (In 2018, President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal). That’s the money the United States ""gave"" Iran (it wasn’t tax dollars).
The reference to Russia stems from an often misunderstood sale of a U.S. uranium company to a Russian business.
The two events are in no way linked.

But there’s no evidence that Smith’s departure was connected to a meeting two days earlier between Attorney General William Barr and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the channel’s founder, despite what some social media posts have implied.
""Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr had a closed door meeting with Rupert Murdoch and the very next day Shepard Smith, one of the only voices on Fox News that is critical of Trump steps down after 23 years,"" said an Oct. 11 Facebook meme posted by The Other 98%, a progressive activist group focused on combating corporate greed. ""But I’m sure it’s just a coincidence!""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The meme did not explicitly accuse Barr of forcing Smith’s ouster, but it misleadingly implied that his meeting with Murdoch played at least some role in the matter. Several other public figures, such as MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and comedian Kathy Griffin, also speculated on Twitter about a link between the Barr-Murdoch meeting and Smith’s exit.
Hmmmmm. Openly gay, honest journalist Shep Smith resigns the day after CORRUPT AG Barr meets w Rupert Murdoch. https://t.co/cOmqHbZHcg— Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) October 11, 2019 
But Chris Giglio, Smith’s personal spokesperson, told the New York Times that ""there is absolutely no truth"" to the notion that the Barr-Murdoch meeting precipitated Smith’s departure. 
""This was Shep’s decision and his alone,"" Giglio told the New York Times. ""He’s taking an extended period of time off to be with his family. Following that who knows — he is not retiring.""
CNN’s Brian Stelter and Fox News’s Howard Kurtz both swatted down the idea that Murdoch ushered Smith out at Barr’s behest, as well.
CNN reported that Smith asked Fox News management for a way out of his multi-year contract in September, well before Barr’s meeting with Murdoch. Smith was reportedly frustrated by attacks the network’s primetime opinion hosts were making against the news division.
One of Fox’s original hires in 1996, Smith was most recently the network’s chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news. He hosted ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" on weekday afternoons and frequently drew President Donald Trump’s ire for his reporting.
...Court Justice & I turned him down (he’s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn’t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I’m President!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019 
Smith announced his departure during his show, expressing thanks for the opportunities his career at Fox News gave him and hope ""that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, (and) that journalism and journalists will thrive.""
""Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News,"" Smith said on air, echoing a formal statement he made in the network’s press release. ""After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement, I won’t be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future.""

The private meeting between Barr and Murdoch occurred Oct. 9, according to the New York Times. It’s not clear who was present or what was discussed, and Fox News and the Justice Department did not respond to our requests for comment.

3,"As mayor of Newark, N.J., Cory Booker ""stole $600,000 from a city water authority and laundered it through his law firm.""","on Monday, October 14th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/14/roger-stone/old-roger-stone-video-about-cory-booker-has-gone-v/,False,Roger Stone,An old Roger Stone video about Cory Booker has gone viral on Twitter. It’s false,"An old video from a Republican political operative alleging that Cory Booker laundered money as mayor of Newark, N.J., has resurfaced on Twitter.
The video, which was originally published on Facebook in September 2018, shows Roger Stone talking to the camera about Booker, a Democratic U.S. senator from New Jersey and a candidate for president.
Stone is a veteran political consultant for Republicans and worked on Donald Trump’s campaign in 2015. Stone was charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice and lying to Congress during former special prosecutor Rober Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He is banned from social media pending a federal trial.
""As the mayor of Newark, Sen. Cory Booker took $600,000 from a city water authority and put it in his pocket. He told four different stories about it,"" Stone said in the video. ""If Cory were a white Republican, he’d be in prison right now.""

(Screenshot from Facebook)
A tweet from Red Nation Rising copied the video and its caption and published it Oct. 6. It’s been retweeted more than 7,000 times, so we wanted to check it out.
We reached out to Stone for the evidence he used to make his claim against Booker. We’ll update this story if we hear back.
An old water scandal
The source of Stone’s claim about Booker can be traced back to a corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp. But there is no evidence that Booker, who was Newark mayor from 2006 until 2013, contributed to the bribery scheme.
In 2014, a year after Booker left his post as mayor, a state controller report found ""an egregious and yet preventable abuse of public funds"" at the watershed. The city of Newark delegated water management to the agency through service contracts valued at roughly $10 million annually, but the report said the agency operated ""free from any meaningful oversight.""
The controller found that watershed Executive Director Linda Watkins-Brashear had authorized ""risky investment activity in an account that lost more than $500,000 in public funds."" The agency dissolved in 2013 shortly after the controller first discovered the abuse of funds.
Watkins-Brashear was later sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison for handing out $1 million worth of contracts to her friends and ex-husband. At least eight other individuals connected to the scheme were also indicted — but not before the watershed’s board of trustees sued Booker, Rep. Donald Payne Jr., D-N.J., and two dozen others for their alleged roles in the waste of taxpayer money.
RELATED: Recent statements by and about Cory Booker
The lawsuit claimed the actions of the defendants, including alleged misappropriation and waste of corporate assets, had led to the agency’s dissolution. Booker’s attorneys said at the time that the suit mischaracterized his role with the watershed.
NJ.com reported that Booker served as an ex-officio chairman of the watershed’s Board of Trustees (a position he held by virtue of being mayor), but he never attended a meeting. The lawsuit alleged that Booker’s lack of oversight led to the agency’s mismanagement.
A federal judge disagreed and, in June 2016, Booker’s name was dropped from the lawsuit. The judge ruled that Booker was immune from liability since his chairmanship was a function of his mayorship.
""Because there is no dispute that Booker was acting as a public employee in serving on the Board, and no argument that his actions (or inactions) as a member of the Board were other than discretionary and/or legislative in nature and required the exercise of his judgment, the Court finds that Booker is immune under N.J.S.A. § 59:3-2(a) and (b),"" Vincent Papala, a U.S. bankruptcy judge, wrote in the opinion.
How Booker’s old law firm is connected
It appears that Stone took two stories about Booker’s old law firm and used them to spin a conspiracy about his involvement in the water scandal.
The first story was published by the New York Post in 2013. It reported that Booker’s federal tax returns showed he collected $689,500 in payments from Trenk DiPasquale, the senator’s former law firm, between 2007 and 2012 — while he was mayor of Newark. 
Booker had previously said he stopped working for the firm in 2006, soon after he became mayor. Booker’s spokespeople told the New York Post at the time that the money wasn’t a salary, but part of a ""separation agreement"" with the firm. The Daily Beast reported the agreement was paid out for work Booker did for the firm before he became mayor.
From 2010 to 2012, Booker reported on his tax returns that he ""materially participate[d] in the operation of this business."" A Booker spokesman told the New York Post it was an error made by a tax preparer.
The second story, published by Politico in January 2017, reported that Elnardo Webster, one of Booker’s longtime advisers, was the general counsel for the watershed while he worked at Trenk (and while Booker was mayor). However, neither he nor Booker have been charged with wrongdoing related to the bribery scandal.
The Post reported that, as of 2013, Trenk had made $212,318 from the watershed. That’s one-third of the $600,000 Stone alleged. According to a review of existing media reports and court records, there is no evidence of a money laundering scheme involving the two entities.
Booker’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Our ruling
In a 2018 video, Roger Stone claimed Cory Booker ""stole $600,000 from a city water authority and laundered it through his law firm."" The video has recently resurfaced on Twitter.
That claim is related to a decade-long corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp., which Booker oversaw as mayor and ex-officio chairman. At least nine people have been indicted or sentenced in connection with the bribery scheme. But there is no evidence, based on court records and other existing reporting, that the former mayor contributed to the scheme.
As to Stone’s specific claim, there is no public paper trail connecting Booker being paid by a former law firm, and that firm being paid from the watershed. Stone is using two independent facts to create a conspiracy. We rate his claim False."
3,"Says the Associated Press was wrong to report that ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years"" because in a ""new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades.""","on Saturday, October 12th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/oct/12/kevin-brady/income-inequality-growing-or-shrinking-united-stat/,Mostly False,Kevin Brady,Is income inequality growing or shrinking in the United States? | PolitiFact Texas,"U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, tried his hand at fact-checking in a tweet that suggested a news report from The Associated Press inaccurately characterized the state of income inequality in the United States.
His post — which caught our attention due to his unauthorized use of a PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter image — started by summarizing the findings of the news article: ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years.""
""FACT: Just the opposite,"" Brady wrote. ""In new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades.""
We had to ask: Who is right? Is the United States experiencing the highest levels of income inequality in the past 50 years, or do the latest figures show a decline in inequality?
News reports describe growing inequality
Let’s start with The Associated Press article, which was published upon the release of new income information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey at the end of September.
""The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality,"" the story reads, attributing the information to the Census Bureau.
The article goes on to discuss a change to the Gini Index — a common summary measure of income inequality. The value ranges from 0 (perfect equality, when everyone receives an equal share) to 1 (perfect inequality, when one group or recipient receives all the income).
In 2018, the American Community Survey put the Gini Index at 0.485, a statistically significant increase from 2017, when the Gini Index was estimated to be 0.482.
Multiple news outlets wrote articles about the new data released by the Census Bureau, including The Washington Post.
""Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago, according to data released Thursday, even as the nation’s poverty and unemployment rates are at historic lows,"" the Post article reads.
National Public Radio reported that the ""gap between the richest and the poorest U.S. households is now the largest it’s been in the past 50 years.""
In the Census Bureau’s press release announcing the latest survey, the agency said income inequality in 2018 was ""significantly higher"" than in 2017.
So, how is it possible that Brady came to a different conclusion about the status of income inequality in the U.S. after reviewing Census Bureau data?
""The most obvious thing going on is that they are talking about two different data sources,"" said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center who studies trends in income and wealth.
Two surveys have different results
Isabelle Gwozdz, a spokeswoman for Brady, said his claim was based on the latest report of the Current Population Survey released by the Census Bureau in September.
The Current Population Survey is a joint effort between the Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to track statistics on employment, earnings and education across the country.
It is a different project than the American Community Survey, which has a significantly larger sample size and collects information on population, housing and other topics — including income.
Kochhar said the Current Population Survey should be ""understood as a national survey,"" while the American Community Survey ""is designed for measurement across states, metro areas and counties.""
""The two surveys are different in methodology, sample size, and reporting period, so it’s not unusual for them to report slightly different findings,"" said David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.
A key difference between the surveys is that the Current Population Survey asks more detailed questions about income than the American Community Survey. Plus, the Current Population Survey uses a smaller sample size.
For analyzing national income estimates, the Census Bureau generally recommends using the Current Population Survey over the American Community Survey, according to a statement from the agency.
While the Current Population Survey can show changes in income inequality over longer periods of time, ""it is relatively rare for year-to-year changes in the Gini to be statistically significant,"" due to the small sample size of the survey, according to the statement.
The Current Population Survey also uses the Gini Index, as well as three other summary measures of inequality — Theil, Atkinson and Mean Logarithmic Deviation — while the American Community Survey only includes Gini.
""However, they are also difficult to interpret, whereas the Gini has a more straightforward interpretation,"" reads the statement from the Census Bureau. ""The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of inequality.""
The value for Gini can vary, depending on the survey and other factors.
Gwozdz said when Brady referenced ""four measures of income inequality,"" he was looking at values for Gini, Theil, Atkinson and the Mean Logarithmic Deviation from the Current Population Survey report on 2018 Income and Poverty.
The Current Population Survey report uses two different ""income concepts"" to measure inequality: money income and equivalence-adjusted income.
Money income is household income, while equivalence-adjusted income considers the number of people in a household and how they might share resources.
Looking just at money income, all four summary measures appeared to show declining inequality from 2017 to 2018. But none of the decreases is considered statistically significant.
""If I go to the CPS estimate for 2018, it is no different than the estimate for 2017, statistically speaking,"" Kochhar said. ""It did decrease, but it was not enough to be statistically significant. All you can say from CPS is that there was no change between 2017 and 2018.""
The Census Bureau analyzed changes to the Gini Index in the Current Population Survey report and said that, from that data, ""we cannot say with confidence whether the Gini increased slightly, decreased slightly, or was relatively unchanged.""
Looking at equivalence-adjusted income, all four measures decreased from 2017 to 2018. Three of the measures, not including the Mean logarithmic deviation, saw a statistically significant decrease.
The Census Bureau and economics experts we consulted for this fact-check said it is normal to see variations in these measurements, depending on the source of the data and the income concept used for the estimate.
Ken-Hou Lin, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that both The Associated Press and Brady should be more cautious with their interpretations of the Census Bureau data.
""In general, there’s never a large year-to-year change in inequality,"" he said. ""Thus, it is difficult to separate the real trend from statistical noise.""
Kochhar agreed, and said looking at incremental changes to income inequality does not tell the whole story.
""I would conclude that, in the times we currently are, income inequality is higher than it has been in five decades,"" Kochhar said. ""Whether this year is different than last year, that is one slice out of the five decades.""
Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute offered a similar assessment.
""Bottom line: The AP story is accurate,"" Cooper said. "" None of the statistics that Mr. Brady cites disprove anything that the AP story reports.""

Our ruling
Brady said that the Associated Press was wrong to report that ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years"" because in a ""new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades.""
Brady used a different Census Bureau survey than the Associated Press to make his claim. Both surveys had slightly different findings about income inequality — a normal occurrence, according to multiple experts.
The survey the Associated Press used showed a statistically significant increase in income inequality from 2017 to 2018, using the only measurement of inequality included in the survey.
In the survey Brady cited, estimates for four measures of income inequality were generated using two different categories of income.
In one category, three of the four measures saw a statistically significant decrease from 2017 to 2018. In the other category, none of the measurements experienced a statistically significant change.
Plus, experts said year-to-year changes in income inequality are not indicative of larger trends, so it is a stretch to suggest that the 2018 figures signal a reverse in the rise over the past five decades.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

MOSTLY FALSE — The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."

The photos are genuine, and it’s true that Robert Soros is George Soros’s son. He also married a woman named Melissa Robin Schiff in May 1992. In September 2017, the New York Post reported that they were estranged and divorcing. 
But Melissa Schiff is not Adam Schiff’s sister. The wedding announcement that ran in the New York Times back in 1992 identifies her parents as Marlene Schiff and Haskel Schiff, both of New York. 
Adam Schiff was born to Edward and Sherrill Schiff in Framingham, Mass., according to this 2017 U.S. News & World report article. The Jewish Journal reported that year that Schiff was the youngest of two sons born to the couple.
Claims about Schiff’s connection to Soros have been swirling since at least early last year. Back then, the congressman told FactCheck.org that he has just one sibling — his brother — and has no known family relationship to Melissa Schiff.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.
In the Sept. 9 Facebook post, Manchin wrote, the ""West Virginia Department of Education reported over 10,000 children & youth have been identified as homeless for the 2018-2019 school year. That's disturbing news, and that's why I invited U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to come to #WV and see the impact this is having on our children & schools."" 
The post proceeded to link to a news release outlining his request to DeVos.

 
Is Manchin correct about the scale of the K-12 homelessness problem?
Official data from the state education department shows that Manchin is correct -- and that the problem is getting worse.
The number of homeless students has risen since the 2014-15 school year from 8,959 to 10,522 in the 2018-19 school year -- a 17% increase. Making the increase even more striking, the state’s overall population has actually fallen by almost 2% during that period.

It’s worth noting that the statistic uses a federal definition known as McKinney-Vento, which counts students as homeless if they live in shelters, hotels or motels, cars, RVs, or with another family member away from their primary residence. Students who are in foster care are not included in these numbers. 
Why is West Virginia seeing an increase?
Rebecca Derenge, the state official responsible for tracking homeless students, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the opioid epidemic and floods three years ago may have disrupted family situations for some West Virginia residents.
As it happens, this statistic had already caused some controversy in West Virginia by the time Manchin wrote his post. 
Initially, the statistic for homeless students was left unmentioned during a major battle over education legislation, and it only came to light after reporting published July 20 by Amelia Ferrell Knisely of the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
The Gazette-Mail reported that ""several lawmakers admitted the thousands of homeless students weren’t mentioned in months of debate leading up to the final vote"" on a major education bill. 
Republican state Sen. Patricia Rucker, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, told the newspaper that the homeless-student statistic was never mentioned by school officials or the state education department.
Then, after the statistic came to light, state schools superintendent Steven Paine told West Virginia Board of Education members that, while the number is ""staggering,"" its rise over the years ""was not a significant increase,"" the Gazette-Mail reported Aug. 16.
Paine later apologized for the comment, the Associated Press reported, issuing a statement that he ""in no way intended to convey that the data was not significant.""
Our ruling
Manchin wrote that the ""West Virginia Department of Education reported over 10,000 children and youth have been identified as homeless for the 2018-2019 school year."" 
The state education department reported that the number of homeless K-12 students in West Virginia for 2018-2019 was 10,522. We rate Manchin’s statement True."

3,"Says the whistleblower hired ""left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding all of them.""","on Friday, October 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/oct/11/mark-levin/fact-checking-claims-about-whistleblowers-legal-te/,Mostly False,Mark Levin,-checking claims about the whistleblower’s legal team | Pund,"President Donald Trump and his allies are trying to discredit the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump and Ukraine prompted House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry by attacking the whistleblower’s lawyers.
Trump once asserted that former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was headed by ""hardened Democrats"" and ""big Crooked Hillary supporters."" Now he’s claiming the whistleblower’s attorneys are ""big Democrat(s)"" driven by politics and out to get him.
On Oct. 3, Trump tweeted a clip of conservative commentator Mark Levin on Fox News host Sean Hannity’s primetime TV show. Levin claimed, without evidence, that the whistleblower hired ""left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding all of them.""
pic.twitter.com/WaLS3cL5ng— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019 
""He happens to get a Schumer-Clinton lawyer, who happens to work with a group called Whistleblower Aid,"" Levin said in the video. ""And Breitbart has a great piece on this. They were founded in 2017 for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration."" 
We reviewed voter registration information, campaign finance filings and LinkedIn profiles for each of the whistleblower’s three lawyers, who did not respond to requests for comment.
We found little evidence that they are ""left-wing lawyers"" working for ""left-wing firms,"" and no evidence whatsoever that their work is being funded by George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.
Who are the whistleblower’s attorneys?
The whistleblower is represented by Compass Rose Legal Group, a Washington law firm focused on security clearance, federal employment and national security issues.
The firm’s three attorneys — Andrew P. Bakaj, Mark S. Zaid and I. Charles McCullough III — have represented the whistleblower ""from the outset,"" according to a statement. (McCullough has not signed on to more recent statements.)
Bakaj, the lead attorney, is a former intelligence officer and criminal investigator who was himself a whistleblower while working for the CIA inspector general, according to the Washingtonian. 
Meanwhile, Zaid runs his own national security law firm. McCullough is a longtime government official who most recently served as the first ever intelligence community inspector general, working under the director of national intelligence from 2011 to 2017.
Are they liberals?
We checked public records from Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. Currently, Bakaj is registered to vote in D.C. with no political affiliation, Zaid is registered in Maryland with no political affiliation, and McCullough is registered in Maryland as a Republican.
So where did Levin, Trump and others get the idea that they are ""left-wing"" lawyers?
Levin did not respond to our requests for comment, but his claims that the whistleblower’s lawyers lean to the left can be largely traced to reports from conservative news outlets such as Breitbart and the Washington Free Beacon.
On Sept. 24, Breitbart reported that Bakaj’s ""resume includes work for"" former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
The following day, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Bakaj donated this year to former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. 
The same outlets have also drawn attention to tweets Bakaj and Zaid have posted about Trump, in which they have poked fun at Trump, questioned his fitness for office, urged officials to blow the whistle on government misconduct and offered lower rates for would-be whistleblowers.
It’s true that Bakaj donated to Biden. According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, he gave $100 to the Biden campaign on April 26. 
The Breitbart story leaves out that Bakaj worked as an intern, not as a staffer, for Clinton, Schumer and the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, according to his LinkedIn profile. Bakaj was not on their full-time staffs, nor did he represent them as a lawyer.
In response to a related critique from Fox New host Laura Ingraham, Zaid dismissed Bakaj’s internships on Twitter. ""Andrew — when he was 19/20 & in college — interned w/ Senators Schumer & Clinton,"" Zaid wrote. ""Almost 20 years ago.""
Zaid donated to the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee between 2005 and 2014. In an interview with The Hill, Zaid said the donations were silent auction biddings that he made as a guest at the committee’s spring ball. We could not find record any individual donations from McCullough.
On Twitter, Zaid listed a number of times when he has represented conservatives. He twice represented GOP members of Congress on cases related to the Freedom of Information Act, and he has represented the Republican National Committee as well.
He also represented five CIA whistleblowers in the Benghazi case, and he represented the Daily Caller, a conservative publication. 
""The partisans are trying to smear the legal team as some liberal opposition,"" Zaid wrote. ""We are anything but that."" The Hill quoted two colleagues of Zaid saying he’s hardly political.
As far as we could tell, Bakaj has not made any similar public statements. 
Levin’s other allegations
Levin also claimed that Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal group that supports whistleblowers, was created ""for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration."" Zaid and Bakaj are affiliated with the group, which set up a GoFundMe to help pay for the whistleblower’s services.
Support for Levin’s claim seems to come from Breitbart, which noted that an old version of the group’s website said ""our Republic is under threat.""
But aside from that now-deleted language and the fact that the group was founded in 2017, during Trump’s presidency, there’s no evidence that the group is targeting Trump. When it was created, founder John Tye explicitly said it was ""not a partisan effort.""
The claim that Soros is involved is more far-fetched. A Breitbart article mentions Soros numerous times, but each alleged link shows the billionaire several degrees of separation away from the whistleblower’s lawyers. We could not find any credible evidence connecting Soros to the whistleblower’s efforts.
Our ruling
Levin said the whistleblower hired ""left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding all of them.""
One of the lawyers, Bakaj, donated $100 to Joe Biden and worked as an intern for Schumer and Clinton almost 20 years ago. None of the lawyers are registered Democrats.
Furthermore, there’s no evidence that their firm leans to the left or receives funding from Soros.
We rate this statement Mostly False."
3,Says the Obamas are connected to the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal.,"on Friday, October 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/11/facebook-posts/no-obamas-have-nothing-do-varsity-blues-college-ad/,False,Facebook posts,"No, the Obamas have nothing to do with the ‘Varsity Blues’ college admissions scandal | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","Is the Obama family embroiled in the high-profile college admissions bribery scandal, ""Operation Varsity Blues""?
That’s what one popular Facebook post claims.
The post was shared by the page ""American Web Media"" and displays an image of former president Barack Obama along with the words ""Obama’s Connection to Scandal Revealed.""
The post’s caption says, ""The Obama family has now been connected to the country’s biggest scandal"" with a link to American Web Media’s article.
The post, which has gotten over 2,000 comments and more than 1,200 shares since Oct. 9, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
No, the Obamas have not been named in, or speculated to be connected with, any criminal activity related to the scandal. 
The false headline of the American Web Media article, ""Obamas Connected To College Admissions Scandal,"" is clickbait. The body of the article says there is ""no link"" between the former first family and the scandal. 
Federal prosecutors first released information about the scheme during a press conference in March 2019, when they announced charges against numerous wealthy parents accused of using bribery to influence undergraduate admissions for their children at top American universities. The investigation has implicated over 30 people, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.
So, what is this headline-grabbing connection that the Obamas have to the scandal? This: Michelle Obama and daughter Malia took tennis lessons with a coach who was later accused of taking bribes when he served as the tennis coach at Georgetown University. 
The former Georgetown coach, Gordon Ernst, has been accused of accepting millions in bribes to help put at least 12 students on the university’s tennis team — including some who had minimal skill and never played the sport competitively
But there is no indication, in the indictment or elsewhere, that the family had any knowledge of or involvement in Ernst’s activities. 
Even the American Web Media article (which spells Ernst’s last name wrong) points this out:
""Although Michelle and Barack hired Gordon to teach their daughters the sport of tennis, there is no link between the Obamas and this college admission scandal. But it does go to show you how these schemers were dealing with some of the nation’s most prestigious people – and were trusted industry insiders. No one would have suspected that Gordon Ernest was really trying to conspire to commit racketeering.""
This is a baseless rumor. The article’s false headline was used solely to generate website traffic which it obviously did, becoming fodder for viral social media posts like the one that caught our attention. We rate it False."
3,"""Fact: Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor .... Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company. Fact: Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President.""","on Friday, October 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-ad-misleads-about-biden-ukraine-and-prosecut/,False,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump ad misleads about Joe Biden, Ukraine and the prosecutor","A campaign ad from President Donald Trump claims it has ""facts"" about the Bidens and Ukraine, but instead mashes ideas together to create a highly misleading 30-second tale.
""Fact: Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor,"" the narrator says, and then cuts to a clip of a Biden statement: ""if the prosecutor is not fired you’re not getting the money. Well son of a bitch, he got fired.""
The ad then continues:
""Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company. Fact: Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President. Fact: Donald Trump won but Democrats want to overturn the election.""
The ad distorts the known facts about Ukraine prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, where Biden’s son Hunter Biden served on the board.
The Trump campaign announced the TV ad on Oct. 9. It has also been visible on social media.
Key takeaways:
• Biden did want Shokin fired, but western leaders had widely criticized the prosecutor general as corrupt and ineffective. Biden was leading a widespread consensus in asking for removal.
• A former Ukrainian official said the investigation into Burisma was dormant under Shokin.
• Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry for Trump’s statements suggesting he wanted Ukraine to investigate a political rival in exchange for political favors.
""Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor.""
Biden did call for Ukraine to fire Shokin, but the ad fails to note that there were widespread calls for his ouster.
Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. 
The Trump campaign ad includes a clip of Biden’s partial reports at a Jan. 23, 2018, event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. Biden spoke about getting a commitment from then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and from then-Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.
""I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,"" Biden recounted. ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""
""Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company."" 
There is evidence that many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of Yanukovych’s and Poroshenko’s circles. 
When Shokin was fired in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. 
Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that ""virtually everyone"" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine ""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired."" 
""All decent people were in favor of Shokin's sacking,"" Anders Åslund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact. ""Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus.""
Shokin did inherit some of the investigations into Burisma and owner Zlochevsky. Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster. 
But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin’s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was ""shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,"" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account.
The Trump campaign pointed to reporting by the New York Times that Yuriy Lutsenko, a subsequent prosecutor general, had cleared Burisma initially but then reopened the investigation in March.
At the very least, Shokin's credibility in discussing the case has been undercut by other evidence and the widespread descriptions of his office as uninterested in prosecuting corruption cases.
Democrats’ impeachment inquiry
The ad says that ""Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President."" 
The ad soft-pedals Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 by describing it merely as a discussion. The ad omits that a summary of the call shows Trump encouraging Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr and ""look into"" Biden.
Before the call, Trump froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine. The hold on the money was lifted Sept. 11. 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would move forward with an impeachment inquiry in September. Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power by withholding the aid while asking its government to look into Biden, his potential 2020 opponent. They have not yet formulated articles of impeachment. 
Our ruling
A Trump ad says ""Fact: Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor .... Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company. Fact: Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President.""
Biden called for Ukraine to fire Shokin, the prosecutor general, but so did many others. The facts show that Biden wanted Shokin removed due to widespread concerns that Shokin was ineffective in pursuing corruption cases — not that he was too aggressively pursuing cases. The Trump campaign cites Shokin himself, but he is not a reliable source. And Democrats want to impeach Trump for using foreign policy to promote his own re-election, not his desire to investigate corruption. 
This ad claims a compilation of ""facts,"" but it’s presentation and lack of context is so misleading as to be inaccurate. We rate this statement False."
3,"Millionaires are eligible for food stamps, but ""Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it.""","on Friday, October 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/11/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-lawmakers-claim-millionaires-are-eligibl/,True,Glenn Grothman,Wisconsin lawmaker's claim that millionaires are eligible for food stamps is in the bag | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a news release about proposed new rules for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.
The release said the proposed rule ""would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don’t need it.""
What does that mean, exactly?
Here’s how U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, framed it when backing the plan in an Oct. 2, 2019 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 
""A lot of people didn’t know that millionaires are eligible for food stamps,"" he said. ""I’m glad Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it.""
The article noted nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose food benefits under the proposed changes. The state would also have to upgrade its computer systems, retrain workers and make other changes that would cost millions of dollars a year.
But let’s return to Grothman and his claim.
Is he right that millionaires are eligible for food stamps? 
Let’s take a look.
How the program works
According to the Journal Sentinel article:
Nearly 40 million people, including about 644,000 Wisconsinites, received food stamps in 2018. Like most states, Wisconsin provides food benefits to people who qualify for other government programs without performing additional income and asset tests.
The proposed rule would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps. Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250.
For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month.
Nationwide, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and cut benefits to about 3 million people.
As the Journal Sentinel article noted:
In Wisconsin, about 39,600 people in about 24,100 households would lose more than $11 million in benefits a year, according to estimates from the state Department of Health Services. Of those, about 13,000 are children and about 11,000 are senior citizens. 
So, where do the millionaires come in?
The back door, apparently.
The evidence
When asked to provide backup, Grothman’s staff pointed us to several news articles, including a Sept. 16, 2019 report from the Washington Examiner that reminded readers about the case of Leroy Fick who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in the Michigan State Lottery in 2010. 
""Fick used his winnings to buy a new home and an Audi convertible, all while continuing to receive SNAP benefits,"" the Examiner article said.
That story has been making the rounds for a while.
In 2011, ABC News reported on the Fick case with a headline that asked: ""How can a man who won millions in the lottery still use food stamps?"" 
At the time, Michigan used federal guidelines that based eligibility for food stamps solely on income. The state considered Fick’s $850,000 lump sum lottery payment an asset -- not income. So, under state policy then in effect, Fick could legally get food stamps. 
The state subsequently banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program. That ban knocked Fick off the food stamp rolls.
According to a Congressional Research Service report on the SNAP program, as of October 2018, 34 states -- Wisconsin among them -- that do not check the assets of people applying for food stamps.
In announcing the proposed rule changes, there was no mention of lottery winners, but USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue referred to the case of a well-off Minnesota man, retired engineer Rob Undersander, who signed up for food stamps to prove a point. 
In a Sept. 28, 2016 opinion piece for The St. Cloud (Minn.) Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, Undersander said he and his wife have a net worth that ""exceeds $1 million.""
In that and other accounts, he said he wanted to expose a loophole that would allow people who are wealthy, or at least those not needy, to qualify for food stamps. So he filled out an application for food stamps in June 2016. He said he was up front about his assets.
Undersander said he gave the money he received to charity
When his case was described at a June 20, 2019 House agriculture subcommittee, the story ignited a partisan firestorm.
Democratic lawmakers accused Undersander of ""defrauding the government with a ridiculous millionaire stunt."" Republicans hailed Undersander for ""exposing the flaws of a failed system."" 
The Wisconsin picture
In a Sept. 23, 2019 letter to Perdue, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and 14 other Senate Democrats urged the Trump administration to withdraw the proposal. The letter cited the negative consequences of the rule and argued the administration has not conducted an accurate analysis of its impact on children and families.
Other Democratic officials, including Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul are also opposed to the change.
""The bottom line is you’d have more cost on bureaucracy and administration and fewer benefits going to Wisconsinites,"" Kaul said in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 
To be sure, the reduced threshhold would not apply just to millionaires. It would also apply to people who make just a dollar a year more than the current guidelines -- folks who are far from wealthy. 
Grothman is standing behind the proposal. 
""It’s obviously frustrating for people living paycheck to paycheck to know that the person ahead of them in line using FoodShare may have $200,000 in the bank,"" Grothman told PolitiFact Wisconsin.
Our ruling
Grothman claimed millionaires are eligible for food stamps, but ""Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it."" 
The millionaires may be outliers, but Grothman’s claim was that they are eligible -- not that they were receiving benefits in high numbers. 
The proposed rule from Trump’s USDA would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps. It would also require a review of an applicant’s assets -- not just their income. It’s that provision that has, in the past, allowed wealthy individuals to receive the benefits.
Wisconsin is among dozens of states that do not do asset checks now.
We rate Grothman’s claim True."
3,"""Teachers in Chicago Public Schools are paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.""","on Friday, October 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/oct/11/lori-lightfoot/are-chicago-public-school-teachers-among-nations-h/,Mostly False,Lori Lightfoot,Are Chicago Public School teachers among the nation’s highest paid? | PolitiFact Illinois,"While defending Chicago’s offer to the union representing the city’s public school teachers, Mayor Lori Lightfoot claimed it would provide them with a generous salary increase — on top of an already high payscale.
At a town hall Lightfoot held last month, a high school student told the mayor students need teachers to be paid well, emphasizing the role they play in students’ lives.
""I agree with you 100% that teachers are important,"" Lightfoot responded. ""Teachers do need to be paid well, and in Chicago, they are. Teachers in Chicago Public Schools are paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.""
The city’s offer to increase teacher pay by 16% over five years, Lightfoot added, is ""a good deal.""

The city’s last contract with the Chicago Teachers Union expired in June, and the district’s 25,000 teachers and support staff have set an Oct. 17 strike date if a deal isn’t hammered out by then.
Is Lightfoot correct that teachers in Chicago are already among the nation’s highest paid? We decided to find out.
A dearth of data
Under the most recent contract, the district’s base salary for a new teacher with a bachelor’s degree is just under $53,000. The maximum salary a teacher can earn in CPS after years of experience and with higher credentials is a little more than $101,000. That’s before the value of required annual pension contributions the district makes on a teacher’s behalf.
In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Lightfoot’s office provided a spreadsheet comparing CPS teacher salaries at different levels in their careers with those in districts in the nation’s 10 other largest cities, and pointed us to some state-level salary data.
But Lightfoot didn’t limit her comparison to what teachers make in other large cities, so we went looking for more comprehensive data to assess her sweeping claim.
None of the sources we found allow for a direct comparison of overall teacher compensation — not just salary, but pension and health care benefits — across all districts nationally.
However, figures compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonpartisan policy and research center, make it possible to compare teacher salaries at various levels of education and experience among the nation’s 124 largest districts.
During the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary. The survey adjusted for cost of living using a measure developed by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Chicago’s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center’s analysis. For example, a teacher with a master’s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago’s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group’s database.
Even so, Lightfoot didn’t constrain her remarks to the nation’s 100-plus largest districts either. And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives.
""A salary schedule really doesn’t tell you what the reality is on the ground,"" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn’t say how many teachers are actually making that pay. ""It says contractually, this is where people would be if they’re at this level.""
So we turned to data obtained by the Better Government Association through an open records request to the Illinois State Board of Education to see how Chicago stacked up within state lines. (The Better Government Association runs PolitiFact Illinois.)
The short answer: Not so well.
Chicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state’s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone. Including bonuses, health and pension benefits, its ranking rose somewhat. But it still trailed 34 other districts, many of them located in the more affluent suburbs outside Chicago and in the surrounding collar counties.
Ben Ost, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told us it’s likely CPS trails districts in similar suburbs throughout the nation as well.
Our ruling
Lightfoot said Chicago Public School teachers are ""paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.""
Data from teacher salary schedules compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality shows Chicago ranks 22nd among the nation’s 124 largest districts for starting salary. Its ranking also nears the top of the list for teachers with more years of experience and higher degrees.
But Lightfoot didn’t limit her remarks to larger districts, nor to salary. So we turned to Illinois data, which shows CPS ranks well outside the top 20 for average teacher compensation in its own state.
We rate Lightfoot’s claim Mostly False.

MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

3,"""About 95 percent of America’s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana.""","on Thursday, October 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/west-virginia/statements/2019/oct/10/david-mckinley/fact-checking-ethylene-production-us/,True,David McKinley,-checking ethylene production in the U.S. | PolitiFact West Virgin,"Three U.S. House members from West Virginia have proposed creating an Appalachian Storage Hub to store and transport large amounts of natural gas liquids in the region.
One of those House members is West Virginia Republican David McKinley. In a news release announcing House Resolution 4433 -- the Appalachian Regional Energy Hub Initiative -- McKinley said he backs the effort and cited Hurricane Harvey, the 2017 storm that shocked coastal Texas and Louisiana, as evidence that a more reliable storage system is needed.
""Developing such a ‘Hub’ in Appalachia would bring significant investment and jobs to the region,"" McKinley said in his op-ed for the Fairmont News.
In his news release, McKinley wrote that the danger for the nation is that today, ""about 95% of America’s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana — a region exposed to major storms like Hurricane Harvey.""
Is he right about that percentage? We took a closer look.
What is ethylene?
First, let’s explain what ethylene is.
Ethylene is commonly used to produce polyethylene, which is one of the most commonly produced plastics in the world. Food packaging and containers, bottles, and housewares are among the products manufactured from polyethylene.
McKinley’s District of Columbia office pointed us to a report to Congress by the U.S. Energy Department released in November 2018.  
The report includes a line that says that ""ethylene production capacity is highly concentrated in the United States Gulf Coast; over 95% of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana.""
The figure below illustrates the total capacity in million metric tons that each region produces, the majority of which comes from Texas and Lousiania. 

Documented Ethylene Production Capacity in the U.S. (Source: Ethane Storage and Distribution hub in the United States)
After Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. in Texas and Louisiana, 60% of the production capacity in America went offline, causing problems for industry, at least in the short term.  
It’s worth noting that these numbers can be expected to shift once a major ""ethane cracker"" plant in Monaca, Pa., comes online in another year or two. 
Crackers are facilities that break down ethane into multiple byproducts, including ethylene. The Shell Chemicals facility in Monaca is expected to produce 1.6 million metric tons per year of ethylene.
The Energy Department report cites two additional ethylene facilities in the Appalachian region that are on the drawing board, though they are slated to come online after the Monaca plant. They are in Washington Bottom, W.Va., and Shadyside, Ohio.
Our ruling
McKinley said, ""About 95% of America’s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana — a region exposed to major storms like Hurricane Harvey.""
The scale of operations in Appalachia are on track to grow in the coming years, but for now, McKinley is correct: Energy Department data shows that more than 95% of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana. 
We rate his statement True."
3,"Says the sons of Nancy Pelosi, Mitt Romney and John Kerry are all on the boards of ""energy companies doing business in Ukraine.""","on Thursday, October 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/10/facebook-posts/pelosi-romney-and-kerry-dont-have-sons-working-com/,False,Facebook posts,"elosi, Romney and Kerry don’t have sons working for companies linked to Ukraine | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","Hunter Biden isn’t the only politician's child who’s been scrutinized in the past few weeks for his work overseas.
On Facebook, several widely shared posts claim the sons of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, are also on the boards of energy companies linked to Ukraine. Other posts add former Secretary of State John Kerry to the mix.
""Biden’s son, Pelosi’s son, Romney’s son (are) all on the board of director (sic) for energy companies doing business in Ukraine,"" one post reads.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And they’ve collectively reached thousands of users, so we wanted to check them out.
The source material of the posts appears to be a viral tweet published Oct. 6 by Jack Murphy, co-founder of conservative news site TrendingPolitics.com.
""Biden's son, Pelosi's son, Romney's son, Kerry’s son,"" he tweeted. ""All are on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine… Coincidence? No.""

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We reached out to Murphy for the source of his post, but we haven’t heard back. Several conservative publications had reported on the allegations about Pelosi’s son, Paul, days before Murphy made that assertion.
We looked into the business dealings of Pelosi, Romney and Kerry’s sons. 
Claims about Pelosi’s son are misleading
Paul Pelosi Jr. once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil, that dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name. But Paul Pelosi had no part in the new entity, and it’s unclear to what extent the company has done business in Ukraine.
Reports of the connection appeared in One America News Network and other conservative outlets, the source of which appears to be an Oct. 3 tweet from Patrick Howley, a writer for The Epoch Times. The pro-Donald Trump website has been known to publish conspiratorial content.
""BOOM: Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Pelosi Jr. (who went to Ukraine in 2017) was a board member of Viscoil and executive at its related company NRGLab, which DID ENERGY Business in UKRAINE!"" Howley said in the tweet, which has been retweeted more than 12,000 times. ""And Nancy Pelosi appeared in a promotional video for the company!""
As evidence, Howley linked to two YouTube videos published March 5, 2013. The first shows Paul Pelosi speaking at an event in Washington.
The video opens with clips of a speech from Nancy Pelosi and then shows Paul at an XPRIZE Foundation competition in September 2010. The nonprofit group organizes public competitions with businesses to encourage their technological development. 
RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place
""My name’s Paul Pelosi, of course I’m on the board of Viscoil, and Viscoil’s here today to talk about accelerating the future,"" he says during the video.
Viscoil was a California-based holding company that dissolved in 2010. An old version of the company's website said the company was created to ""engage in research and in the commercial development of hydrocarbon production methods and technologies.""
After it shuttered, Viscoil was folded into NRGLab, a Singapore-based company ""specializing in different areas of scientific research."" It appears to have published the YouTube videos.
The second video Howley posted shows Walter Afanasieff, a Brazilian-American musician, talking about how technology could improve oil extraction. The caption lists other artists that had promoted Viscoil’s work, including Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer and actress.
""Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,"" the caption reads. An SH-box is a kind of environmentally friendly generator, according to NRGLab.
We found a Facebook page on which Newton has promoted NRGLab’s work, but we could find no news coverage about the company's dealings in Ukraine. NRGLab does not mention the country on its website. We reached out to the company for more information but did not get a response.
To sum it up: Paul Pelosi served on the board of Viscoil. At one point, a Ukrainian singer is alleged to have promoted the company. But Pelosi was off the board before that happened. That’s the connection people have identified.
Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact that Paul Pelosi worked for Viscoil for a short time. He denied that it had any dealings in Ukraine at the time.
""The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business,"" he said in an email. ""The company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.""
What we know about the other lawmakers’ sons
Hunter Biden did serve as a board member for a Ukrainian energy company, from 2014 until the spring of 2019. As for the sons of Kerry and Romney, there is no evidence to suggest that they ever held similar positions.
Burisma Holdings appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors in 2014 to help the energy company improve its corporate governance and adopt Western-style transparency. His father, the former vice president and Democratic candidate running for president in 2020, has faced criticism for the appointment over a conflict of interest.
Kerry has three stepsons from his marriage with Teresa Heinz, heiress to the H.J. Heinz ketchup fortune: John IV, André and Chris. John is an educator, while André is an environmentalist.
RELATED STORY: Ask PolitiFact: Answers to reader questions about the Trump impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden
Chris is a businessman with extensive experience in private equity and venture capital — including pursuing a string of investment and consulting firms with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, another businessman who was Chris Heinz’s roommate at Yale University. He co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners, a Washington investment fund, in 2009 with Biden and Archer.
Biden and Archer would later serve on the board of Burisma, but Chris Heinz never did. In fact, he advised Archer against joining the board and, when both he and Hunter didn’t heed the warning, Heinz ended his business relationships with them.
""Chris has never been on the board of any energy company; nor has he ever traveled to or worked in Ukraine,"" a spokesman for John Kerry told PolitiFact in an email.
All the Heinz children are board members of the Heinz Endowments, the philanthropic arm of their family’s estate, but we could find no evidence that any have served on the board of an energy company linked to Ukraine.
Romney has five sons who work in a variety of different fields: Tagg, Matt, Craig, Josh and Ben. We could find no evidence that any of them have served on the board of an energy company with ties to Ukraine.
Tagg Romney runs a private equity firm called Solamere Capital. Matt Romney runs a firm called Excel Trust, which owns shopping centers across the United States. Craig Romney works in real estate. Josh Romney is the founder and president of The Romney Group, a real estate company based in Salt Lake City. Ben Romney is a radiologist in Utah.
We reached out to a spokeswoman for Romney for more details about his sons’ business dealings, but she declined to comment on the substance of the Facebook posts.
""We don’t comment on fake news from random online trolls,"" Romney spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email.
Our ruling
Several Facebook posts claimed that the sons of Biden, Pelosi, Romney and Kerry are on the boards of ""energy companies doing business in Ukraine.""
Beyond Hunter Biden’s already well-known tenure as a board member for Ukrainian energy company Burisma (which ended in spring 2019), this claim is inaccurate and represents a false attack against those who have spoken out against Trump.
Pelosi’s son, Paul, briefly served on the board of an American energy company before it dissolved in 2010, but there’s no evidence the company had dealings with Ukraine while he held that seat. Kerry stepson, Chris, has worked with Hunter and another former Burisma board member in the past, but he severed ties after they joined the energy company in 2014. There is no evidence that any of Romney’s sons have served on the board of any energy companies with ties to Ukraine.
We rate these Facebook claims False.

3,"Says Republican Dan Bishop was ""down by 17"" points in NC congressional race and then won ""by a lot.""","on Thursday, October 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2019/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-wrong-about-north-carolina-congressional-ele/,False,Donald Trump,Trump wrong about North Carolina Congressional election polling | PolitiFact North Carolin,"President Donald Trump recently cast himself as the hero in a story about a congressional race in North Carolina, according to a speech recently obtained by Bloomberg News.
The congressional race was in North Carolina’s 9th district, where Republican Dan Bishop defeated Democrat Dan McCready in a special election on Sept. 10.
Trump’s comments came during a private event in New York on Sept. 27. Trump told the crowd that Bishop was behind in the race until he visited North Carolina and tweeted about the race.
""But the candidate, Dan Bishop, won — by a lot. He was down by 17, and they had lines a mile long. I mean the lines going into those voting booths were unbelievable,"" Trump said, according to Bloomberg’s transcript of the speech.
This is at least the second time Trump has claimed that Bishop was down 17 points. The first came on the night of the election.
""Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win,"" he tweeted.
PolitiFact looked at publicly available polling, as well as the race results, to see whether Trump was correct about its competitiveness.
We couldn’t find any public poll that showed Bishop behind by 17 points, or even double-digits. And we found his description of the election results to be exaggerated.
WHAT POLLS REPORTED
The website FiveThirtyEight tracked some of the polling of the district. No public poll had McCready up by 17. The most favorable poll for him had him up five points, and the poll most favorable to Bishop had him up four points.
A Co/Efficient poll published three days before the election had McCready up three points. Public Policy Polling, known as PPP, conducted a private poll of District 9 residents about two weeks prior to the election. That poll showed Bishop up, said Tom Jensen, the company’s director.
Vox, an online news source, conducted a similar fact-check and couldn’t find a poll to support Trump’s claims, either.
The piece of polling that comes close to supporting Trump’s claim was tweeted by Jim Blaine, a campaign consultant for Bishop. An internal campaign poll showed McCready up 14 percentage points on Bishop.
But that poll is an outlier. And details — such as who conducted the survey, who responded to the survey, the date — aren’t available to the public.
PolitiFact contacted Blaine and Samantha Cotten, a regional communications director for Trump’s campaign, but didn’t receive a response by the time this fact check was published online.
THE RESULTS
Most experts considered the race a toss-up, a surprise given the district’s history.
""While we’ve thought the Republicans were better positioned to win the NC-9 do-over special election — and that may end up being the case — the latest data, and the latest circumstances, suggest that the race is close enough that we should make it a Toss-up with less than a week to go until Tuesday’s election,"" Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, wrote on Sept. 5.
Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016. No Democrat had won the congressional race since 1963, according to the Charlotte Observer.
It didn’t happen this year either.
Bishop beat McCready by 3,788 votes — 96,573 to 92,785. That breaks down to 50.69% of the vote for Bishop and 48.70% of the vote for McCready, a difference of 1.99 percentage points.
Not exactly a blowout.
OUR RULING
Trump said Bishop was ""down by 17"" points in NC congressional race and then won ""by a lot."" No public polls came close to supporting Trump’s claim, and the final margin was only 2 percentage points. We rate this claim False."
3,"""Meth production in MO has cratered over last decade. MO Hwy Patrol reported 1,326 meth lab seizures in 2006, only 50 in 2018.""","on Thursday, October 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/missouri/statements/2019/oct/10/josh-hawley/missouri-meth-use-hawley-right-lab-seizures-have-d/,True,Josh Hawley,"Missouri meth use is up, but Hawley is right: lab seizures have dropped dramatically | PolitiFact Missour","In a recent Twitter conversation, Sen. Josh Hawley was accused of scapegoating Mexico for Missouri’s meth problem.


""Don’t blame Mexico for what is produced in our own state under your watch,"" the tweeter, identified as Conrad Hake, wrote. Hake was responding to Hawley’s demand that Democratic presidential hopefuls should declare whether there’s a security threat at the border.


Hawley responded: ""Wrong. Meth production in MO has cratered over last decade. MO Hwy Patrol reported 1,326 meth lab seizures in 2006, only 50 in 2018. But meth addiction & overdoses are skyrocketing. DEA’s 2018 Threat Assessment Report says most of meth in U.S. made in Mexico & smuggled over border.""


That would be a huge decrease, and the DEA report does say meth in the United States is made in Mexico and transported into the United States, so we decided to do some digging on the numbers of meth production.


Missouri State Highway Patrol’s report holds up


The numbers are correct, according to a Missouri State Highway Patrol report. Incidents in Missouri for methamphetamine chemical/equipment/glassware seizures, laboratories and dumpsites was 1,326 in 2006. The most incidents were in St. Charles, at 125 in the same year.


In 2018, Missouri had 50 methamphetamine incidents, the report said.


""The key factor for the decrease in methamphetamine laboratories is the transportation of crystal methamphetamine into the state,"" said Sgt. Shawn Griggs, Missouri State Highway Patrol spokesman. Missouri production is down, but consumption of meth is still here.


Methamphetamine is still being used


Hawley cited the 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment released by the DEA. It reports that most methamphetamine in the United States is being produced in Mexico.


In 2006, federal and state laws restricted the sale of an over-the-counter cold medicine, pseudoephedrine, that was essential to home-cooked meth. Griggs said 75 communities in the state have created prescription-only ordinances for pseudoephedrine products.


In 2017, Missouri joined an electronic system that tracks and limits the sale of over-the-counter cold and allergy medications containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.


As pseudoephedrine became harder to get in Missouri, production shifted to Mexico, which now manufactures more meth than the United States.


Chris Twitchel, a captain in the Camden County Sheriff’s Department and an adjunct professor of criminology and sociology at Columbia College, said nine years ago a big drug bust would be getting a few ounces. In the middle of September, the drug task force in Camden County got 2 pounds from a guy. ""I think it’s less risk to buy it from a source than try to make it on your own,"" Twitchel said.


According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri’s drug-related deaths increased 18.1% from February 2018 to February 2019. Delaware is the only state with a higher increase at 18.6%. Meanwhile, nationally the amount of drug-related deaths decreased 3.9%.


According to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, from 2012 to 2016 people seeking treatment for meth addiction in Missouri increased 52%.


Our ruling


Hawley tweeted, ""Meth production in MO has cratered over last decade. MO Hwy Patrol reported 1,326 meth lab seizures in 2006, only 50 in 2018."" The numbers are correct for methamphetamine equipment seizures, laboratories and dumpsites, according to state and federal reports. So we rate this claim True."
3,"Says Nancy Pelosi’s ""legislative aide … is from the Ukraine and is connected to the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian party life""","on Wednesday, October 9th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/09/facebook-posts/viral-rumor-about-pelosi-ukrainian-legislative-aid/,False,Facebook posts,"Viral rumor about a Pelosi Ukrainian ‘legislative aide’ twists facts, exaggerates connection | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","After House Democrats moved forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over a phone call with Ukraine’s president, a photo of a woman shaking hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated as supposed evidence of Pelosi’s own connections with Ukraine elite.
In reality, the rumor is an attempt to smear Pelosi using an American college student only because she was an intern of Pelosi's for a semester and is of Ukrainian descent. 
The photo, shared here Oct. 1, has appeared all over social media with text around it that says:
""Nancy Pelosi’s legislative aide, Ivanna Voronovych, is from the Ukraine and is connected to the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian party life … How did this Ukrainian get cleared to work in the office of the person third in line to the U.S. presidency?"" 
Another image laid over the photo in the upper left hand corner shows a man and a woman along with more text that says, ""Patriarch Filaret Head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" and ""Mom’s Ukraine Order of Merit for Military & Political Activity.""
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This claim is inaccurate. 
PolitiFact found that Ivanna Voronovych did serve as an intern in Pelosi’s district-focused office in Washington, D.C., for a college semester, but did not (and does not currently) work for Pelosi as an aide, nor does she hold any other position in Pelosi’s office. (Also, the Speaker of the House is second in line to the presidency not the third, as the post states.)
The rumor appears to have originated with a Sept. 30, 2019, story by right-leaning website the Gateway Pundit.
That story says Voronovych ""started her career working at the US Embassy in the Ukraine in Kiev"" and that ""she worked for Roman Woronowycz, the Kiev Bureau Chief, who is connected to Nancy Pelosi."" It goes on to claim that, ""Voronovych’s parents are well connected. Her mom worked with the Ukrainian Army, and even received the Ukraine Order of Merit for military and political activity. Yoronovych’s [sic] father worked in the Ukrainian Foreign Service and he’s also connected to the Ukrainian government.""
Something to note: Roman Woronowycz is Voronovych’s father and is not listed as the bureau chief for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, though he does work at the U.S. Agency for International Development in Kiev, according to an agency spokesperson.
PolitiFact reached out to Voronovych about the rumors. She responded by email, explaining that she is a U.S. citizen and has lived in Ukraine as well as other countries due to her father’s employment with USAID. She said that she interned for Pelosi in the spring of 2018 while a sophomore at Northeastern University in Boston and when Pelosi was the House minority leader.
Voronovych said her father is a Michigan native and is not chief of the Kiev bureau of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, as the post states. Voronovych is now a senior at the University of Michigan, where, as a transfer student, she is studying political science and philosophy.
""Since finishing my internship I have not had any contact with the Speaker, as I imagine she is occupied with more important things than keeping tabs on her previous interns,"" Voronovych said. She said she has spent the last five years working as a summer hire at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine but never worked with the Ukraininan Embassy in the United States or elsewhere. ""I have no ties to the Ukrainian government or military outside of the work that I did while employed with the State Department."" 
Ivanna Voronovych’s mother, Viktoria Voronovych, is a Ukrainian-born American citizen and co-founder of the nonprofit International Alliance for Fraternal Assistance, which has helped raise money to deliver medical supplies, gear, equipment and other items to Ukrainian soldiers who were fighting against Russia-backed rebels, according to an interview she gave in 2015 to the Macomb Daily, a newspaper in Detroit. The photo in the upper-left corner of the viral Facebook post shows Viktoria Voronovych receiving a medal from the patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for her conflict zone volunteer work, according to Ivanna Voronovych, who also sent PolitiFact an image of the medal, which indicates it was presented in 2015.
Ivanna Voronovych said that the organization, which appears to be based in Kiev, raised money from other Ukrainians now living in the United States, most notably Michigan, Illinois and North Carolina. These days, Ivanna Voronovych said, her mother’s work involves supporting people with disabilities sustained either at birth or by way of involvement in the conflict.
""This story is a hoax and an outlandish compilation of twisted lies,"" Voronovych said. ""I have received disturbing messages from people that choose to believe this disinformation, making me feel unsafe and as a possible target. The comments under some of the Facebook posts alone are enough to make one worry. I am a private citizen and should not be subject to such an invasion of privacy, libel and defamation of my character.""
On Oct. 3, Woronowycz also posted a response to the rumors surrounding his daughter on his Facebook page, saying she is an American citizen who interned with Pelosi while also working at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during summers. He wrote that the rumors have even resulted in death threats:
""My daughter, Ivanna Voronovych, was hit hard two days ago by bots with stories that contain outright lies and twisted facts. She is an American citizen, an honors student and a social activist who also interned with Speaker Pelosi, while also working at the US Embassy in Ukraine during summers. She has no connections to the Ukrainian military or the Ukrainian Embassy. Dozens of pieces by fly-by-night sites are sharing these gross and dangerous lies. The results have been death threats and lurid comments made by obviously deranged, heartless, soul less, and morally empty a*******. No one deserves this.""
Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, confirmed to PolitiFact that Voronovych was an intern in Pelosi’s personal office in Washington, which works solely on representational issues for Pelosi’s congressional district, the 12th District of California.
""This individual was an intern in our personal office (meaning CA-12 not leadership office). She was an unpaid intern in the spring of 2018 who answered phones and performed other administrative duties,"" Hammill wrote in an email. ""The Speaker takes a photo with every intern during their time in Washington.""
On May 31, 2018, in that same time period, Voronovych posted the photo of herself shaking hands with with Pelosi on her own Facebook page.
Our ruling
A Facebook post displays an image of a woman shaking hands with Nancy Pelosi and claims that the woman, Ivanna Voronovych, is ""Pelosi’s legislative aide"" from the Ukraine who is connected to ""the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian party life.""
Ivanna Voronovych has lived in Ukraine and once served as an unpaid intern for Pelosi for a semester in 2018. But she is also a U.S. citizen and is not employed by Pelosi. Her mother, an American citizen, has also been an activist in Ukraine and previously helped deliver food and supplies to army members.
This rumor wrongly suggests Voronovych, an American, is a significant influence on Pelosi, based only on Voronovych’s Ukrainian heritage and because she once held an internship in Pelosi’s office.
We rate it False.
Update, Oct. 10, 2019: This story has been updated to reflect that a spokesperson with the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed that Roman Woronowycz is employed there. This addition does not affect the ruling."

We compared the whistleblower complaint with the White House memorandum of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
What we found is Trump’s wrong: The whistleblower got just about everything right.
Here are the excerpts from the whistleblower’s filing (in bold), followed by whether the information is confirmed.
Early in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. — Confirmed by the memorandum of the call.
After an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests. — Setting aside the characterization of the purpose as ""personal interests,"" the allocation of the number of words between pleasantries and a request for help with investigations accurately reflects the memorandum.
The complaint then describes what Trump wanted Ukraine to do.
Initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. — Confirmed, according to the memorandum that quotes Trump as saying the following: ""The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.""
Assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that The Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike. — Confirmed, according to the memorandum. Trump is quoted as saying: ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. 
""As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.""
Meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem. — Confirmed, according to the memorandum: Zelensky is the first to bring up Giuliani’s name. As for what Trump said, he did mention both men several times and in tandem.
Trump: ""Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.""
Trump: ""I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people.""
Trump: ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."" 
The President also praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position. — This is ambiguous. Trump made no reference to Lutsenko by name. What he said was, ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."" 
Trump might have been thinking of the previous prosecutor general Viktor Shokin; that would fit more with a prosecutor who had been ""shut down."" The current prosecutor at the time, however, was Lutsenko. From the memorandum, which indicates that certain sections were left out and doesn’t name the prosecutor, we can’t tell for sure.
I was told by White House officials that no other (corruption) ""cases"" were discussed. — The memorandum shows that only the DNC server and the Bidens came up.
I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call. — Unconfirmed. One news report based on an unnamed source said Brechbuhl wasn’t on the call.
We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.
Our ruling
Trump said that the whistleblower ""got my phone conversation almost completely wrong."" In reality, the complaint got nearly every detail correct, as the memorandum released by the White House shows.
It was correct on the request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the notion that Ukraine might have the DNC server that was hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election.
It was correct that Trump aimed to connect the Ukrainians with Giluiani and Barr, even down to the detail of Trump mentioning the two in conjunction.
The complaint described Trump as attempting to pressure Ukraine. That is a matter for the impeachment inquiry to resolve, but the details the whistleblower offered to back that up are correct.
We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
4,"""Republican policies have led to business investment growth that’s 10 times
faster than what we saw under President Obama.""","on Wednesday, October 9th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/09/ron-johnson/wisconsin-gop-sen-ron-johnson-overreaches-economy-/,Mostly False,Ron Johnson,Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson overreaches on economic growth claim | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Republicans love praising the Trump economy. 
With one of the lowest unemployment rates in years and steady job growth, there’s a lot to boast about. 
But just how well does the Trump administration’s overall economic performance compare to his predecessor Barack Obama? And how has the business climate fared under the two presidents?
Here’s what U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed in a July 15, 2019 tweet:
""Republican policies have led to business investment growth that’s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama."" 
The numbers don’t lie, he says. But how exactly is he measuring them?
Although the tweet is a bit old, the issue will be an important one in the coming election, so we decided to take a look.
The data
To come to his conclusion, Johnson’s staff told us he used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that measures economic growth.
Johnson pointed to statistics measuring ""private fixed investment, nonresidential"" which show how much businesses invest in structures, equipment and intellectual property, such as software and research and development. 
Johnson broadly said growth has been 10 times faster under Trump than Obama in his tweet. Those who read it would, presumably think it took in Obama’s entire eight year tenure.
But in the data Johnson used, he only compared the final two years of the Obama administration, 2015 and 2016, to a little over the first two years of data for the Trump administration. That approach often signals cherry-picking.
Let’s dig deeper.
""We use the final two years of the Obama administration for comparison because it constitutes a comparable length of time with the two years of data for the Trump administration,"" said Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for Johnson. ""It is a time adjacent to, rather than remote from, the Trump years.""
According to Johnson’s data points, Obama had an average of 0.6% growth in that period, compared to 6.4% under Trump.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis updated the data shortly after Johnson made the statement. In doing so, figures for some of the quarters were slightly adjusted, but the overall trend was largely the same. 
The new numbers showed between 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration had an average business investment growth of 0.7%. Meanwhile, between 2017 and 2018 (and the first quarter of 2019), the Trump administration had a growth of about 5.5%.
That’s not far off from the original numbers, though quite not as strong. 
The full picture
Of course, Obama’s term did not start in 2015. 
Under the full eight years of the Obama administration, the rate of business investment growth was about 3.7%. When bringing Trump’s term to the overall latest numbers, overall growth has been about 4.9%.
So, looking at all of Obama’s tenure, the numbers are much more comparable.
What about the beginning of Obama’s term. How does it compare to the beginning of Trump’s term?
In Obama’s first two years plus an additional quarter -- the period cited by Johnson -- the business investment rate actually declined by 0.3%. This was the period immediately after the Great Recession.
That underscores the volatility of the numbers -- and how the timeframe you pick can make a major difference.
Other measures, other factors
There are other ways to examine business growth -- and another part of the claim to consider: Johnson asserts the growth was caused by GOP policies.
Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations.
Why? The nation’s GDP -- a conventional measure of the size of the economy -- has also grown over time.
""The share of GDP going to ‘private fixed investment, nonresidential’ is below the peaks seen in the 1980s and 2000s,"" Sinclair said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.
Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it’s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes.
Indeed, as we have noted time and again in fact checks, experts say it is wrong to attribute too much to individuals or particular policy changes. There are simply too many factors in the economy to boil it down to one.
""As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,"" Sinclair told us.
Our rating
Johnson said ""Republican policies have led to business investment growth that’s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama."" 
That language may leave the reader thinking the comparison is to Obama’s full term. Johnson, though, said he was only comparing the first two years of Trump to the last two years of Obama. By that measure, there’s an element of truth here.
But that element is undermined by the broader picture: When you look at all of Obama’s tenure and other measures, such as share of GDP, the picture is much closer to even between the two.
In addition, Johnson over-attributes the cause of recent growth to GOP policies, when there are many other factors at work.
Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here."
4,"Del. Danica Roem ""supported a controversial bill that would have allowed abortion up until the moment of birth.","on Wednesday, October 9th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/oct/09/kelly-mcginn/kelly-mcginn-invents-position-danica-roem-abortion/,False,Kelly McGinn,Kelly McGinn invents position for Danica Roem on abortion bill | PolitiFact Virgin,"Republican challenger Kelly McGinn is sending mailers saying Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, backed controversial legislation early this year that would have eased Virginia’s abortion laws.
""Diane Roem supported a controversial bill that would have allowed abortion up until the moment of birth,"" the mailer says.
Roem says the claim is untrue, so we fact-checked it.
McGinn cites as evidence an unsuccessful bill introduced in January 2019 by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax. It would have removed a requirement that women undergo an ultrasound and be presented with materials on fetal development and adoption before an abortion. It would have eliminated a mandate that second-term abortions be performed in hospitals. 
Most of the debate, however, focused on the bill’s provisions for rare third-trimester abortions, which are allowed if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health.
The legislation would have lowered the threshold from three physicians to one. That doctor would only have to certify that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" test would have been repealed.
Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 29 hearing, acknowledged that her bill would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating. Many Republicans claim the bill shows that Democrats - as McGinn says - support ""abortion to the time of birth.""
But Roem, as first reported by the Prince William Times, has no direct connection to the bill. She was not among 21 Democratic cosponsors of the legislation and she was not a member of a House subcommittee that killed the measure on a partisan 5-3 vote. Roem never voted on the bill. We found no record of her endorsing the bill. Roem says that’s because she never did.
Why does McGinn say she supported it? Zac Obermiller, McGinn’s campaign manager, told us the campaign made what it thinks is a safe assumption. ""The McGinn campaign has simply taken Del. Roem at her word regarding her heretofore unqualified and full-throated support for abortion rights throughout all nine months,"" he wrote in an email.
Obermiller noted that Roem is among 40 legislators endorsed in August by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia for having ""a 100% voting record in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights."" He also noted that Roem has received $12,000 in campaign contributions since 2017 from Emily’s List, a pro-abortion rights PAC, according to records of the Virginia Public Access Project.
But Roem told us told us she would have voted against Tran’s bill if she’d had a chance because, when she went back to her district after the measure died, voters told her they disliked the legislation. ""That’s what you do as a legislator; you represent your constituents,"" she said.
Obermiller said Roem is being disingenuous. ""The bottom line is that Delegate Roem wants to have her cake and eat it too,"" he said.
Our ruling
McGinn says Roem ""supported a controversial bill that would have allowed abortion up until the moment of birth.""
No question, Roem is a strong supporter of abortion rights and is backed by pro-abortion rights interest groups. But she did not have an opportunity to vote on the controversial bill McGinn cites and was not among 21 Democratic co-sponsors of the measure. McGinn offers no evidence Roem was backed the bill and says it’s safe to assume that she would have voted for it. Roem says she would have opposed it based on feedback from her constituents.
There’s plenty for the candidates to debate on abortion. But McGinn doesn’t get to make up a convenient record for her opponent.
We rate McGinn’s statement False."
4,"""A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal!""","on Tuesday, October 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/west-virginia/statements/2019/oct/08/shelley-moore-capito/could-west-virginians-be-out-70000-year-under-gree/,Mostly False,Shelley Moore Capito,"Could West Virginians be out $70,000 a year under the Green New Deal? | PolitiFact West Virgin","Republicans have focused their attacks on a congressional Democratic proposal known as the Green New Deal. 
The proposal, whose highest-profile champion is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is aimed at curbing climate change, but Republicans counter that its associated costs will wreck the economy.
The House version of the proposal has far-reaching environmental goals, including ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible."" It reaches into other domestic policy areas, as well. 
One of the GOP lawmakers who took a shot at the Green New Deal is West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. 
Capito took the proposal to task in an Aug. 20 Facebook post:
""Democrats are desperate to implement their Green New Deal. They care little about the cost and will leave you with the bill! A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal! This doesn’t sound like much of a deal to us!""

 
Capito’s congressional and campaign offices declined to comment for this article, but her Facebook post linked to a Fox Business article that, in turn, cited a study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute on the household effects of the Green New Deal, or GND.
""At a minimum, the GND would impose large and recurring costs on American households,"" the study said. ""We conclude that in four of the five states analyzed — Florida, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania — the GND would cost a typical household more than $70,000 in the first year of implementation, approximately $45,000 for each of the next four years, and more than $37,000 each year thereafter."" 
Pennsylvanians could expect a $72,439 hit. In the fifth state, Alaska, the costs would be the highest of all.
Travis Burk, a CEI spokesman, said Capito’s Facebook statement ""accurately described"" the study.
""The study looked at the available data in those states and estimated increased costs for electricity production, upgrading vehicles and housing, and elements of shipping,"" Burk said. ""In the interest of fairness, the study is transparent about the inability to estimate a price tag for several of the more costly but vaguely-worded elements of the plan, including a universal job guarantee and guaranteed retirement security for all."" Adding in those other elements would mean that Capito was ""underestimating the potential costs,"" Burk said.
There is little doubt that a proposal as sweeping as the Green New Deal would come with a significant price tag. Where Capito’s assertion falls short is in its specificity.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute is ""dedicated to advancing the principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty,"" according to its website — so it’s not surprising that the group would be skeptical of a pro-regulatory plan like the Green New Deal.
More to the point, Capito glosses over some of the study’s shortcomings.
The Green New Deal is an aspirational blueprint rather than a binding piece of legislation. The proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures. And it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on such estimates.
As a result, the details of the proposal are vague and open to a range of interpretations.
The study itself acknowledges that its calculations require ""a considerable number of assumptions"" — assumptions that other policy specialists say will make specific figures hard to pin down.
We have previously fact-checked a statement that, ""at $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789.""
The $93 trillion figure comes from a high-end estimate by a conservative group, the American Action Forum. The CEI study that Capito relied on cited the American Action Forum as a ""key source"" for its own calculations.
As we noted at the time, the American Action Forum report described its estimates as an ""initial foray,"" filled with assumptions and caveats.
The Green New Deal ""lacks too many details to seriously model,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact West Virginia.
Our ruling
Capito wrote that ""a study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal!"" 
Capito cites a study by an anti-regulation group that estimated that the one-year cost to a household in neighboring Pennsylvania would be $72,439. 
However, experts warn that the costs associated with the Green New Deal are too fuzzy at this point to come up with detailed cost estimates. This position is echoed by the report itself, which acknowledges that its calculations require ""a considerable number of assumptions."" It’s also worth noting that the resolution would be non-binding — if it actually manages to secure congressional approval.
We rate the statement Mostly False.

4,"Says Joe Biden ""said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter"" Biden.","on Tuesday, October 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/08/donald-trump/trump-claims-photo-shows-bidens-playing-golf-ukrai/,False,Donald Trump,Trump claims a photo shows the Bidens playing golf with a Ukrainian company ‘boss.’ But it doesn’,"President Donald Trump is doubling down on a photo he says shows Joe Biden and his son posing with a Ukrainian gas executive as evidence Biden knows more than he has let on.
""The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,"" he tweeted. ""Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.""
The photo, which was first aired by Fox News on Sept. 30, shows Joe and Hunter Biden playing golf in the Hamptons in 2014. According to Trump, one of the men is the ""company boss"" of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter served as a board member while his father was vice president. Trump tweeted a doctored Nickelback music video Oct. 2 that includes the image juxtaposed with an interview in which Joe Biden says he had never talked to his son about his business dealings abroad.
That video was quickly removed from both Twitter and YouTube due to a potential copyright infringement for the Nickelback music. But now Trump is re-upping the claim amid an ongoing impeachment inquiry against him for his own dealings with Ukraine.
We reached out to the White House for more information about the source of Trump’s claim, but they did not comment on the record.
Trump’s tweet is misleading on two fronts.
• The photo shows the Bidens with another American board member of Burisma.
• Biden hasn’t said whether or not he’s spoken with Burisma officials.
Who’s really in the photo
Trump claimed that the photo of the Bidens shows them posing ""with the company boss"" of Burisma. Our research shows otherwise.
In a previous story, we found that the man on the far left of the frame is Devon Archer. In 2008, Hunter Biden joined with Archer — a former senior adviser for the presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004 — in a string of investment and consulting firms. 
The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2014 that the two had joined Burisma as board members. That role is different from ""boss"" or ""executive,"" as Trump has claimed in separate tweets about the photo of Archer. Board members are not typically involved in day-to-day operations of a company.
While Joe Biden was vice president, firms run by his son and Archer ""pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,"" the New York Times reported in May.
The fourth man in the photo that Trump tweeted is Ralph Pascucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm. He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014.

(Screenshots from Twitter and Netrex) 
We reached out to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign for more details, but they did not comment on the record.
Taras Burdeinyi is the current CEO of Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky is the founder and owner. In 2014, Alan Apter was the chairman of the board of directors and reportedly brought on Biden and Archer.
What Biden said
In his tweet, Trump claimed that Joe Biden said he ""never spoke to the Ukrainian company"" where his son served as a paid board member. But that mischaracterizes what the Democratic presidential candidate actually said.
In his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group. That’s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma.
RELATED STORY: Trump’s Ukraine call, a whistleblower and the Bidens: What we know, what we don’t
Biden knew his son worked for the Ukrainian energy company. Beyond that, there’s little we know.
Hunter Biden told the New Yorker magazine in July 2019 that he discussed Burisma with his father one time in December 2015. The Biden campaign says the discussion was not substantive.
Our ruling
Trump claimed Joe Biden ""said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company"" where his son, Hunter, served as a board member. He also claimed a photo of the Bidens shows them posing with ""the company boss"" of Burisma.
The photo that Trump is referencing doesn’t show a Ukrainian executive of the company. It shows Devon Archer, a former board member and Hunter Biden’s longtime business partner. Also, Biden never said he had never spoken to Burisma — he said he’d never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. We could find no evidence that Biden ever made the former claim.

That’s correct.","President Donald Trump’s campaign has threatened to sue the city of Minneapolis over the security costs related to a campaign rally.
The Trump campaign said in a statement to the press three days before the rally that the mayor of Minneapolis, Democrat Jacob Frey, had conjured a ""phony and outlandish bill for security"" for the Oct. 10 Target Center rally.
""Frey’s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event,"" the campaign wrote. ""The Target Center attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding the use of the arena.""
The statement said that the $530,000 is more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 health care rally held by President Barack Obama at the Target Center. 
Minnesota has voted for Democrats for president for decades, but Trump has his eye on it because he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton by about 1.5 percentage points. Minneapolis is a liberal bastion in a blue state.
Trump tweeted a response targeting Frey and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat whom he has attacked before.
""The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!""

PolitiFact reached out to multiple city and police department officials as well as the Target Center and its manager, AEG Facilities, and did not receive any responses to our questions. 
However, we did obtain a letter from AEG that cited an estimated $530,000 cost.
Target Center cited a $530,000 cost
Hugh Lombardi, AEG Facilities’ general manager, sent a letter to the Trump campaign’s director of advance, Bobby Peede, on Oct. 7.
The letter states:
""The City of Minneapolis has presented a preliminary estimate of additional security and related costs associated with the October 10, 2019 Event at Target Center. These estimated additional expenses total $530,000.""
The letter states it is the licensee’s responsibility ""to coordinate through the Secret Service and pay for any law enforcement services necessary for the event.""
The letter states that if these arrangements are not confirmed by 8 a.m. Oct. 8, then the agreement will be terminated ""for breach of the Event Security provision."" 
The campaign wrote in a letter to AEG that the campaign and AEG are not required to pay for security and threatened to sue. (We have not seen a copy of the agreement.)
Casper Hill, a city spokesman, told PolitiFact that the public safety costs are expected to be around $400,000 and there are an additional $130,000 costs for lane closure fees and traffic control, among other things. The city examined the costs for other major recent events to determine the costs, including the Super Bowl in 2018, which was roughly $6 million, and $1.5 million for the Final Four men’s college basketball tournament earlier this year. 
Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal told the Star Tribune that ""it’s not fair"" for residents to shoulder the costs. Segal told the Star Tribune that the city has been having conversations with organizations including the Twins, the Vikings and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority about sharing costs of events. Those discussions started before the Super Bowl in 2018, she said. 
Minneapolis’ estimate, however, appears far higher than what it cost other cities to host Trump rallies. The Star Tribune reported that Trump’s rally in Rochester in 2018 cost the city government $76,138 while a rally in Duluth cost the city more than $69,000.
A national investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that among local governments that invoiced the Trump campaign, the amounts ranged between $8,000 to $82,000 for public safety costs related to rallies. The highest bill was from the city of El Paso for about $470,000. 
On the day of the 2009 Obama rally, the Minneapolis police chief estimated the department’s costs to top $20,000 including for 50 officers on overtime at the 20,500-seat Target Center arena, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported. We tried to confirm if that was the actual cost with police officials but did not get a response.
It isn’t unusual for local law enforcement agencies to be asked to swallow security costs, and Trump’s is not the only campaign to do so. The Center for Public Integrity found that Obama’s campaign didn’t always pay for security. Some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates didn't respond to the Center when asked about security bills while others said they will pay or had paid certain bills.
No FEC requirement for candidates to pay security
There is no specific requirement within the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act or Federal Election Commission regulations for congressional or presidential campaign committees to pay for expenses incurred by a state or local government for campaign events, said Myles Martin, an FEC spokesman. 
That means that campaigns can choose to reimburse governments for security costs, but they are not required.
A Secret Service spokesman told PolitiFact that it is not funded to pay police overtime and doesn’t have a mechanism to do so.
""This is a blank spot in campaign finance laws and campaigns often take advantage of it, as the Trump campaign is in Minneapolis this week,"" said Carleton College political science professor Steven Schier. ""It's a low priority for Congress because it does not affect legislators' campaigns in a significant way.""
There is, however, a mechanism for local law enforcement to seek reimbursement for protecting Trump’s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey. 
Our ruling
The Trump campaign said that the Minneapolis ""city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs"" related to a Trump rally, ""more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 Target Center health care rally held by President Barack Obama.""
A letter from AEG to the Trump campaign cites the $530,000 estimated costs. An article in the St. Paul Pioneer Press paraphrased the Minneapolis police chief at the time stating that the costs would be $20,000 for an Obama rally.

Debra Rodman ""opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in event of unplanned pregnancies.""","on Tuesday, October 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/oct/08/siobhan-dunnavant/dunnavant-falsely-claims-rodman-favors-abortion-ov/,False,Siobhan Dunnavant,Dunnavant doesn't prove claim Rodman favors abortion over adoption | PolitiFact Virgin,"State Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R- Henrico is denouncing her challenger, Democrat Debra Rodman, as a ""liberal activist"" who has shown a ""lack of judgement"" during her two years in the House of Delegates.
Dunnavant made the charges in a Sept. 30 mailer that criticizes Rodman on six issues. One particularly caught our attention. She said Rodman ""opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in unplanned pregnancies."" We fact-checked her statement.
Dunnavant’s mailer cites an unsuccessful 2018 bill Rodman co-sponsored that would have changed state mandates for family life education in public schools. It would have abolished what many Democrats said were biased standards calling for ""teaching the social, psychological and health gains to be realized by teenagers’ abstaining from sexual activity before marriage.""
The bill also would have removed the requirement to teach ""the benefits of adoption as a positive choice in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.""
In place of the mandates was a requirement that students get teaching ""that is medically accurate."" 
The bill died in a partisan 12-10 vote in the House Education Committee on Feb. 5, 2018. Rodman voted in the minority with Democrats for the measure.
Marshall Moreau, Dunnavant’s campaign manager, says Rodman’s support of the bill justifies the mailer claim. ""The only inference to be drawn is that Rodman is opposed to adoption as an alternative to abortion in the event of unplanned pregnancies,"" he wrote in an email.
Dunnavant saidin the email, ""For Delegate Rodman to say she doesn't oppose adoption but doesn’t want to teach about it, is like saying ‘I want you to get out of the burning building but I’m not going to tell you where the fire escape is.’""
The bill Rodman backed was silent about adoption. Rodman and other Democrats say the bill wouldn’t have barred instruction about adoption; it would have required that if taught, it be in a neutral, factual way when discussing pregnancy,
Rodman says her position has been contorted by Dunnavant. ""I believe in a woman’s right to choose,"" Rodman said in an email. ""Adoption is a wonderful choice women can and should make if it’s right for them. Politicians should not interfere in this personal choice.""
Our ruling
Dunnavant says Rodman ""opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in event of unplanned pregnancies."" 
She cites Rodman’s support of a bill that would have changed state mandates for family life courses in schools to ensure what Democrats said would be neutral and scientific teaching. It wouldn’t have ended instruction about adoption; it would have erased a requirement for teaching its ""benefits"" as a ""positive choice in the event of an unwanted pregnancy."" 
Dunnavant wrenches that position on teaching to the sensational claim that Rodman supports abortion over adoption. Rodman says she backs choice on adoption and abortion. Dunnavant’s statement goes well beyond that, and she fails to credibly back it up.
We rate Dunnavant’s statement False.
Correction: An earlier version of this fact check gave the wrong date the family life education bill died in the House Education Committee."
4,"""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.""","on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/04/adam-schiff/adam-schiffs-false-claim-we-have-not-spoken-direct/,False,Adam Schiff,Adam Schiff’s false claim that ‘we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower’,"Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in September that the House Intelligence Committee had not communicated with the whistleblower before the complaint about President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filed.
But recent reporting from the New York Times revealed that Schiff, the committee chairman, had indeed learned about the outlines of the whistleblower’s concerns days in advance. 
Seeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, per committee procedures. The aide shared some of that information with Schiff.
As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker first noted, this revelation flies in the face of Schiff’s public comments during the month of September, when he dodged questions about whether he or his committee had talked to the whistleblower and, in one case, denied that they had.
On Sept. 17, more than a week before the whistleblower’s complaint was made public, MSNBC’s Sam Stein asked Schiff if he had heard from the whistleblower and if he wanted to.
""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,"" Schiff said. ""We would like to. But I’m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress, and so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation.""
RELATED: What the whistleblower law says about sharing complaints with Congress
The New York Times report, which quoted Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland acknowledging that ""the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance,"" shows that this statement was inaccurate.
While it was not publicly known that Schiff’s committee had communicated with the whistleblower ahead of the complaint’s filing, Schiff knew the truth. When given the chance to say that the whistleblower had reached out to a committee aide, he did not.
Schiff’s comments
The New York Times reported that the committee aide received only a vague outline of the whistleblower’s concerns. Without revealing the whistleblower’s identity, the aide then told Schiff ""some of what the officer conveyed,"" the report said. Other outlets reported similar details.
Previously, Schiff had given the impression that his committee never spoke to the whistleblower.
Before Schiff’s MSNBC interview — in which he flatly stated, ""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower"" — Schiff also evaded a question from CNN’s Anderson Cooper about whether he’d been contacted by the whistleblower or the whistleblower’s legal representation.
""I don’t want to get into any particulars,"" Schiff said during the Sept. 16 interview. ""I want to make sure that there’s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way.""
Schiff has since clarified his remarks. He told the Daily Beast that until recently, he did not know for certain whether the complaint detailing the Trump-Zelensky call was submitted by the same whistleblower who contacted his staff. 
He also said he thought the questions asking if the committee had heard from the whistleblower were focused on whether the whistleblower had testified privately in Congress.
""I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,""  Schiff told the Daily Beast. ""I regret that I wasn't much more clear.""
In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee said Schiff’s comments on MSNBC were ""intended to answer the question of whether the committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not.""
""Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear,"" the spokesperson said. 
Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s counsel, declined to comment on the whistleblower’s outreach to committee staff but stressed that the whistleblower wrote the complaint ""entirely on their own."" We addressed the false claim that Schiff helped write the complaint in a separate fact-check.
Our ruling
Schiff said, ""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.""
The New York Times and other news organizations later reported that the whistleblower sought guidance from a House Intelligence Committee staffer before formally lodging the complaint.
We rate this statement False."

Adam Schiff knew more about the makings of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump than he let on, according to reporting from the New York Times. But Republicans, including Trump, who have seized on the Times reporting have erred in claiming the reporting suggests Schiff helped write the complaint itself.
The Oct. 2 story said Schiff — the head of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Trump — had learned about the whistleblower complaint before it was officially filed. The newspaper reported that the CIA officer who filed the complaint had approached a committee aide for advice on how to proceed with concerns over Trump’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine.
The article explained how Schiff, D-Calif., knew to press for the release of the whistleblower complaint, which the Trump administration had previously tried to keep from Congress. 
The same day that the Times published its report, several right-leaning outlets jumped on the story, claiming it showed the whistleblower ""colluded"" with House Democrats. During a press conference, Trump claimed Schiff ""probably helped write"" the complaint and called it a hoax. 
One Facebook post published the same day took it a step further, alleging Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., worked with lawyers to ""devise the complaint.""
Another one says, ""Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were participants with attorneys and are complicit in EDITING AND COMPOSING THE ‘WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT’ BEFORE IT WAS FILED.""
Those posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

 
What we know
Schiff ""learned about the outlines"" of the whistleblower complaint from the House Intelligence Committee aide who consulted with the CIA officer, the Times reported. The Times did not report that Schiff helped write, or devised the complaint.
The Times reporting, which relied on anonymous sources and has been corroborated by the Washington Post, shows that the whistleblower approached one of Schiff’s aides with only a vague accusation against Trump. The aide told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Schiff some of what the whistleblower told them. The aide did not share the officer’s identity with Schiff.
The whistleblower’s primary concern centered on the phone call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. 
RELATED STORY: Timeline: The Trump impeachment inquiry
During that call, a summary of which was released by the White House Sept. 25, Trump asked Zelensky to consider reviving an investigation linked to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden’s son had worked for as a board member while his father was vice president. That request came after Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.
The whistleblower reached out to the House Intelligence Committee aide sometime before they filed the official complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community Aug. 12. Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump on Sept. 24, and Schiff is leading that inquiry.
The Washington Post article said it is not uncommon for the House Intelligence Committee to receive informal inquiries from whistleblowers before a formal complaint is filed, according to ""current and former committee staffers."" And the officer took their concerns to the committee only after they had a colleague relay them to the CIA’s top lawyer, which resulted in the CIA alerting the White House. That spooked the whistleblower into taking their concerns directly to the House, the New York Times reported.
What the whistleblower and Schiff say
Schiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress. But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff’s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint.
We asked the House Intelligence Committee what Schiff learned from the aide about the whistleblower complaint. A spokesman declined to comment on the particulars of that interaction, but he denied that Schiff had any contact with the whistleblower directly.
""As Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower’s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the (Department of National Intelligence) when the (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) finally provided it to the Committee,"" the committee spokesman said in an email.
RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place
We also reached out to Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the CIA officer. He said he also can’t comment on what Schiff knew about the whistleblower’s concerns, but that the officer ""drafted the complaint entirely on their own.""
""In fact, none of the legal team saw the complaint until it was publicly released by Congress,"" Zaid said in an email. ""To be unequivocally clear, no member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the complaint before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general. Nor has the whistleblower or the legal team met with or even discussed this complaint with congressman Schiff.""
Our ruling
Several Facebook posts claimed that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint against Trump.
We still don’t know exactly what information Schiff received about the whistleblower’s concerns. But there is no evidence to suggest that Schiff knew who the whistleblower was, much less that he helped them draft this complaint. The Facebook posts go beyond what has been reported.
Absent any additional evidence, the claim that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint is inaccurate. We rate the Facebook posts False."
4,"Says Monica Lewinsky tweeted that she's ""willing to take one for the team"" by engaging in oral sex with President Donald Trump because, ""Apparently that's the only thing that can convince Republicans to impeach.""","on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/04/facebook-posts/monica-lewinsky-didnt-say-she-would-engage-oral-se/,Pants on Fire!,Facebook posts,Monica Lewinsky didn’t tweet she would engage in oral sex with Trump to convince GOP to impeach | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Amid the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a screenshot of a salacious fake tweet attributed to Monica Lewinsky is circulating on Facebook.
The fabricated tweet makes it appear that Lewinsky, a central figure in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice and lying under oath, made a sexually suggestive comment involving Trump, oral sex and her interest in seeing Trump impeached. Clinton’s impeachment charge stemmed from a sexual harassment case, in which Lewinsky, then a White House intern, became famously intertwined following an independent council’s investigation into sexual encounters between Lewinsky and Clinton. 
The viral image in question displays Lewinsky’s real Twitter profile picture and handle. It makes it look like she authored a tweet time-stamped at 6:06 p.m. on Oct. 3, with 1,610 retweets and over 18,000 likes, that read:
""I’m willing to take one for (sic) team and give Trump a b****** in the oval office. Apparently, that’s the only thing that can convince Republicans to impeach.""
The screenshot was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
No, this is not a real tweet written by Monica Lewinsky.
The fake tweet appears to have been created by Instagram user @electorotting — the handle appears in the upper right hand corner of the tweet’s image. A visit to that Instagram profile shows the Lewinsky tweet and several other fabricated tweets and other memes. The same person’s Twitter bio tells people to follow them on Instagram for ""original memes."" In 2018, the user admitted to the Associated Press that he was responsible for creating a fake tweet made to look like it came from President Barack Obama’s verified account.
PolitiFact reached out to @electorotting but didn’t immediately receive a response.
There is no sign of the tweet on Lewinsky’s Twitter profile page. She tweeted multiple times on Oct. 3, but none mentioned impeachment or anything sexually suggestive. 
We also searched Lewinsky’s Twitter handle @MonicaLewinsky in the All My Tweets database, which compiles users tweets in a single webpage, and could not find anything from Lewinsky on Oct. 3 – as the screenshot shows – that references impeachment, Trump or oral sex. 
Another red flag demonstrating that the tweet is fabricated: An advanced Twitter search of its keywords came up with (almost) no results. For a viral tweet that has supposedly garnered thousands of retweets and likes, only one similarly-worded tweet from a user who isn’t Lewinsky showed up on the platform.

4,"""50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification.""","on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/oct/04/roger-williams/are-half-those-arrested-dwis-i-35-unauthorized-imm/,Pants on Fire!,Roger Williams,Are half of those arrested for DWIs on I-35 unauthorized immigrants? | PolitiFact Texas,"During a panel on the border crisis hosted by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, a Republican from Central Texas, answered questions alongside Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Williams said he is frustrated when he hears people characterize the situation at the border as a ""homemade crisis"" or a ""made-up crisis.""
""We’re doing everything we can do to help these folks, but at the same time, we’ve got to get back to defending our borders and the rule of law,"" Williams said at the August event. ""I had a meeting with law enforcement in my district and they said, here’s a fact for you — we’re all familiar with Interstate 35 — they said 50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification. So you give them a ticket, you can’t put them in jail because the jails are full here ... so you send them on their way.""
There are a lot of problems with Williams’ claim.
First of all, he appears to be conflating DUIs and DWIs. He referenced DUIs, an offense reserved for minors who are found to be operating a motor vehicle with any detectable amount of alcohol in their systems, but then went on to discuss placing offenders in jail.
When minors in Texas are apprehended by law enforcement, they are taken to a juvenile processing office and then, if they are not released to a parent or guardian, to a juvenile detention facility.
Also, his claim that individuals pulled over for DWIs are sent ""on their way"" with a ticket because jails in Texas are full is inaccurate. Jails across the state are at varying levels of occupancy and have different practices in place to handle capacity issues.
Williams also did not specify which parts of the freeway he was considering and he did not offer a timeframe for his claim.
After speaking with officials at five law enforcement agencies in Texas and reviewing different records related to arrests and immigration status, it is clear that there is no evidence to support Williams’ claim.
None of the agencies we contacted could provide data to directly inform Williams’ statement. The information they could share revealed that a small percentage of all arrests for people driving while intoxicated are individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.
No official figures on this claim are maintained by law enforcement
Interstate 35 is a roughly 1,600-mile freeway that stretches from Laredo at the Texas-Mexico border to Minnesota. The road runs through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. About 504 miles of the freeway are in Texas.
Williams represents the 25th Congressional District, which includes multiple non-connected stretches of the interstate. In Austin, his district includes more than 3 miles near downtown. It also includes about 55 miles of Interstate 35 West from Abbott to Burleson and about 9 miles of Interstate 35 East outside of Milford.
John Etue, chief of staff to Williams, said that the numbers came from law enforcement officers within the 25th Congressional District ""regarding their personal experiences while performing their duties within their areas of operation.""
""These are not official Texas or DPS stats,"" he said.
Etue declined a request to provide information about the officers who provided the information, including the agency where they work.
I-35 is part of the state highway system and is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation. Various law enforcement agencies enforce traffic laws on these roadways, including the state’s Department of Public Safety, which houses the State Highway Patrol.
Local law enforcement officers also enforce traffic laws on portions of the highways that are within their jurisdiction.
We first turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety for its figures on drunken driving arrests on I-35, but a spokesperson said: ""The data you’re requesting is not something the department tracks.""
Williams said he spoke with officers in the 25th Congressional District, so we turned to four law enforcement agencies with coverage areas that overlap with the portion of I-35 that runs through the district — the Austin Police Department, the Travis County sheriff’s office, the Hill County sheriff’s office and the Hillsboro Police Department.
In Texas, local officers are allowed — but not required — to ask about the immigration status of any individual they detain, including during traffic stops. Local jails also are required to comply with requests from federal immigration authorities to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement places detainers on people who have been arrested on criminal charges and ""for whom ICE possesses probable cause to believe that they are removable from the United States.""
When a detainer is placed on an individual, local law enforcement must hold the individual for up to 48 hours, giving ICE agents time to respond and take custody of the individual.
None of the entities we contacted were able to provide the exact information we requested, due to discrepancies in how information is recorded and maintained across agencies. Open records policies also limit what information can be released about ICE detainers. Only one agency was able to provide any information about whether individuals arrested for DWIs had identification.
Other data highlights problem with Williams’ claim
The Austin Police Department provided figures about all arrests for driving while intoxicated on I-35, but could not provide information about immigration status.
The department has made 3,904 DWI arrests on I-35 from January 2014 through the end of August this year, according to records provided by the department.
The Travis County sheriff’s office tracks people booked into the county jail with DWI arrests who had been flagged by federal immigration authorities, but they do not filter the information by the location of the arrest.
The jail houses individuals arrested across the county by many different law enforcement agencies.
From Aug. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 6,182 bookings into the county jail on new DWI arrests. Of those arrests, 7.4% of those individuals had an ICE detainer.
Also, in Travis County, the court tasked with handling DWI cases had information about DWI arrests and the percentage of people arrested who were from a different country, but court officials were not able to zero in on people here illegally or the location of the arrest. They also could not provide information on whether an individual had identification or not.
Of all the DWI cases that went before the court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% involved people who were not U.S. citizens. It’s unclear what percentage of that group were people who were in the country illegally.
Travis County Attorney David Escamilla, whose office prosecutes misdemeanors like DWIs, said he was not familiar with the figures cited by Williams.
""I’ve never seen that type of metric and I find it highly improbable,"" Escamilla said.
The Hillsboro Police Department was able to provide information about DWI arrests within its jurisdiction and the number of people arrested who were in the country illegally at the time of the arrest, but they could not limit the arrests by location.
From 2011 through 2019, the department made 180 DWI arrests. Of those, three people had ICE detainers. Of those three people, one did not have identification.
Finally, Capt. Justin Motherspau at the Hill County sheriff’s office said the details in Williams’ claim are ""not something that we even have the ability to track.""
Our ruling
Williams said, ""50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification.""
There is no evidence to support Williams’ claim, which an aide said was based on a meeting he had with law enforcement officers in his district. The aide did not identify the officers or the agency where they worked.
Data shows that small percentages of those charged with DWI in jurisdictions along I-35 within the 25th Congressional District lack legal immigration status.

4,"Says ""90% of policemen are for"" expanding background checks to all gun sales.","on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/oct/04/richard-durbin/durbin-mostly-target-claim-about-police-support-ex/,Mostly True,Richard Durbin,Durbin mostly on target with claim about police support for expanding background checks | PolitiFact Illinois,"In remarks during a visit to a Chicago hospital, Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are standing in the way of efforts on Capitol Hill to address gun violence despite widespread public support.
Trump and McConnell, he contended, have stonewalled efforts to expand background check requirements via bipartisan legislation that cleared the Democrat-controlled House more than 200 days ago. Current federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers; the House bill would require background checks for all firearm purchases.
""Background checks just make sense,"" Durbin said. ""Turns out that 90% of policemen are for it, 90% of gun owners are for it, the overwhelming majority of members of the National Rifle Association are for it. And yet this president and the leader of the Senate refuse to act.""
PolitiFact has previously checked claims about broad support for expanded background checks among the general public, along with statements that line up with what Durbin said about gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association widely backing them as well.
But his claim about support among law enforcement wasn’t one we’d heard before, so we decided to check it out.
A spokesperson for Durbin’s office pointed us to results from a survey published in 2017 by Pew Research Center, a generally reliable source for data. Experts we contacted told us they were not aware of any more recent surveys on the topic.
That survey — conducted for Pew by the National Police Research Platform, a consortium of researchers headquartered at the University of Illinois at Chicago — found 88% of police support ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.""
The margin of error for the question was plus or minus two percentage points, according to a Pew spokesperson.
As the survey’s detailed methodology section lays out, interviews were completed online during the summer of 2016 by nearly 8,000 officers from 54 police and sheriff’s departments across the country.
Experts, including at Pew, explained there’s one caveat worth keeping in mind, though. The survey left out more rural, small-town police forces throughout the country: It provides a nationally representative sample of officers working in departments that employ at least 100 full-time sworn officers, but smaller departments were not included.
""While 88% appears to be a good estimate for this sampling frame, it may exclude a fraction of the nation’s officers who disproportionately hold more conservative views on gun control issues,"" said polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis.
However, Smith noted, a substantial majority of police nationwide likely work for departments of the size that were included.
Indeed, 63% of all sworn officers work in departments of more than 100 officers, according to Pew. So the result still speaks for the majority.
To gain some insight into that position, we asked local law enforcement leaders why police are likely to support expanding background checks.
""Most of them want to protect the Constitution,"" said Frank Kaminski, police chief of Park Ridge, Ill. and a former president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. ""But they also see the violence in the streets every day and realize that we have to take common sense measures to reduce it.""
""When we talk about violence, we talk about violence not only to citizens but also to officers,"" he added.
Our ruling
While speaking about legislation that would expand background checks to all gun sales, Durbin said 90% of police back such a policy.
He was referencing a 2017 survey by Pew Research Center, which asked police at departments that employ 100 or more officers whether they support requiring background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows. Eighty-eight percent responded that they did.
However, it’s important to note that survey left out officers at smaller, more rural jurisdictions who may not share the same views, and we could not find any other recent polls that addressed the question.
We rate Durbin’s claim Mostly True.

MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

4,"Universal background checks involve asking people ""to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official,"" and that violates the Second Amendment.","on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/04/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-lawmaker-takes-aim-and-misses-claim-gun-/,Mostly False,Scott Fitzgerald,Sen. Scott Fitzgerald misfires with claim on gun background checks and Second Amendment | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Editor's Note: This item was updated to clarify that firearms dealers are required to fill out and reatain ATF Form 4473 for all types of gun purchases.
Gun control is a contentious topic in Wisconsin’s divided government, with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers planning to force the issue by calling the Republican-controlled Legislature into a special session.
The debate here and elsewhere typically centers on two types of legislation, both of which have been implemented in many other states:
Red flag laws — These allow judges to temporarily remove firearms from people acting dangerously.
Universal background checks — These measures require background checks for sales by private parties, in addition to gun dealers, which are already required by federal law.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald was asked to weigh in on the topic in a Sept. 22, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront."" He said he didn’t see any momentum for red flag laws, then pivoted, unprompted, to the other gun control flashpoint.
""Universal background checks, too,"" said the Juneau Republican, who recently announced he is running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. ""I mean, any time you’re going to ask somebody to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official, it’s going to violate the Second Amendment.""
This raises some questions worth examining. People can disagree on whether universal background checks are a good idea (polling shows most Wisconsinites think so), but we should at least be able to agree on what they are.
So, do background checks really involve submitting serial numbers to the government?
And would that violate the Second Amendment?
How background checks work
Fitzgerald’s office did not reply to our requests for evidence of his claim and more details on his position.
But his response in the TV interview suggests universal background checks are tantamount to a gun registry — where the government keeps a record of which guns each person owns. It’s a common argument from opponents of universal background checks, who see it as a step toward confiscation.
But it’s an over-simplification of a nuanced issue.
There’s no, well, universal version of universal background checks, but the basic concept is that private sellers are subject to the same general requirements as licensed gun dealers, including background checks on the would-be purchaser and keeping records of the sale.
Wisconsin is one of 29 states that currently do not require background checks or record-keeping on private gun sales. At the federal level, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving licensed firearm dealers.
Some states — including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington — require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. They call that the ""most comprehensive policy option.""
Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement.
RELATED: Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order?
In Wisconsin, any universal background check would have to be integrated with the current system for gun dealer sales, which splits background check responsibilities based on the type of gun.
The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, run by the FBI.
What information is submitted to the government
Fitzgerald says he objects to universal background checks because of the new requirements they would place on private gun sales, so let’s examine how those could look.
If Wisconsin implemented a comprehensive universal background check system, routing all sales through dealers, the flow of information to authorities would be the same as it is now for dealer sales.
For long gun sales, dealers fill out ATF form 4473 — which includes the gun make and serial number — and submit it to the FBI’s criminal background system. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours.
The dealer is then required to keep a copy of the 4473 form for at least 20 years. After that point, or if the dealer goes out of business, the form is turned over to the ATF. But federal law forbids the ATF from storing these records in a searchable format or otherwise using them ""to establish any system for the registration of firearms."" The records are retained using decades-old microfilm technology, making gun tracing a painstaking, manual process.
For handguns, Wisconsin dealers still fill out and retain the form 4473, but background checks are done by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. State law requires dealers to submit the name, date of birth, gender, Social Security number and other identifying information to the Wisconsin DOJ. But the agency does not receive or store serial numbers or any other firearm information, said spokeswoman Gillian Drummond.
So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would — eventually — make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database.
If Wisconsin opted for a less comprehensive system, less information would go to the government. For example, if the state DOJ were tasked with all background checks for private sales and private sellers were required to maintain their own records (as in Illinois), no serial numbers would be submitted to any government entity for any private gun sales.
Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment?
All of this brings us to the last element of Fitzgerald’s claim — that submitting serial numbers to government officials violates the Second Amendment.
Courts have said that isn’t true.
Six states and the District of Columbia already require registration of some or all firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center.
""These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual’s Second Amendment rights,"" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""Nothing in any Supreme Court ruling to date would suggest that a government requirement that gun owners provide serial numbers for the guns they purchase or own to government officials violates the Second Amendment.""
For example, a challenge to the Washington, D.C. registration requirement in 2015 was largely upheld by a federal appeals court. The ruling stripped away some elements of the law but left untouched the basic requirement that guns be registered.
Our ruling
Fitzgerald says universal background checks would involve asking people to submit their guns’ serial numbers to the government, which would violate the Second Amendment.
The serial numbers that are submitted for background checks don’t end up in government hands for years or decades. And then the federal agency is barred from fashioning them into a database.
What’s more, there is no evidence such a requirement would violate the Second Amendment, since several states have gun registries that have not been struck down by the courts — and a similar provision was upheld by federal courts in a Washington, D.C. case.
We define Mostly False as ""a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here."

The Founding Father and third U.S. president is widely quoted on the internet and, unfortunately, there are a multitude of misattributions. So add this quote to the tally – there is no evidence that Jefferson said it, and multiple Jefferson researchers told us they’ve never come across it. 
The quote does not turn up in various collections of Jefferson’s writings and speeches. Officials at the University of Virginia Press, which works in conjunction with Founders Online, told PolitiFact that they see no evidence it was said by Jefferson. 
""It is very unlikely that this is a verbatim quotation from anything Jefferson ever wrote himself. The style and phrasing is uncharacteristic, and as you can verify from a search in Founders Online he very rarely used the words ‘uninterested’ or ‘uninvolved,’"" David Sewell, managing editor of Digital Initiatives at the organization, wrote in an email. ""And in fact they were much less common before the 20th century … Especially ‘uninvolved’ in the sense of ‘not active in affairs/politics’ — that is very much a modern usage.""
In previous fact-checks of faux Jefferson quotes, we have mentioned a spurious quotations list compiled on his estate’s website, Monticello.org.
While this particular statement isn’t included in the list, Monticello research librarians told us they couldn’t locate the quote in any of Jefferson’s writings or in print media. 
Lisa Francavilla, managing editor for the Thomas Jefferson Papers at the International Center for Jefferson Studies, said the quote is being parroted all over the internet.
""We have never been able to find any source that confirms that these are words written or spoken by Thomas Jefferson,"" Francavilla wrote in an email. ""It is therefore what we call ‘spurious’ or ‘misattributed.’ We have been unable to confirm a date of origin for it.""

4,Says the character Freddy Krueger was based on a real serial killer.,"on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/04/facebook-posts/no-freddy-krueger-wasnt-based-real-serial-killer-d/,Pants on Fire!,Facebook posts,"No, Freddy Krueger wasn’t based on a real serial killer, despite social media rumor | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","This is the stuff nightmares are made of.
As Halloween approaches, a viral Facebook post claims the infamous ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film franchise serial killer Freddy Krueger was based on a real murderer.
The post displays a photograph of a headstone that reads ""Frederick Kruger 1838-1910,"" with a lengthy caption that reads: 
""DID YOU KNOW...That the Horror Film Character Freddy Kruger was based on a real life serial killer who lived in Rockville, Wisconsin in the 1800s. According to court county records of the time, Mr. Kruger was known to have killed at least twenty children within a three mile radius of where he lived. He reportedly murdered most of the children using only a Gardening claw."" 
It goes onto claim that ""Kruger"" lived in an abandoned factory and was eventually caught after starting a fire in the facility where he ""burned over 70% of his body."" After dying in his sleep at the age of 72, the post says, unexpected deaths occurred to teens and children while they were sleeping, thus later providing inspiration for the notorious Krueger horror character.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Sorry, but we have to lay this spooky tale to rest. Krueger was not based on a real person – the story is entirely made up.
Versions of this claim have been shared on the internet for a few years, with varying details.
A reverse-image search shows that the gravestone image was uploaded in October 2017, around the same time the rumor was first shared on social media. 
But unlike most of the copied and pasted versions that have been shared online since, the original post included a line at the end that admitted the story was made-up as a Halloween joke: ""(Actually, I just found this picture and made all that s*** up. Happy October everyone!).""
Meanwhile, horror film director and Krueger creator, the late Wes Craven, revealed in a 2014 interview with Vulture that he got the idea for the movie from a creepy news story he read in the Los Angeles Times:
""I’d read an article in the L.A. Times about a family who had escaped the Killing Fields in Cambodia and managed to get to the U.S. Things were fine, and then suddenly the young son was having very disturbing nightmares. He told his parents he was afraid that if he slept, the thing chasing him would get him, so he tried to stay awake for days at a time. When he finally fell asleep, his parents thought this crisis was over. Then they heard screams in the middle of the night. By the time they got to him, he was dead. He died in the middle of a nightmare. Here was a youngster having a vision of a horror that everyone older was denying. That became the central line of Nightmare on Elm Street.""
Our ruling
A scary tale that Freddy Krueger was based on a real serial killer is recirculating on social media.
This story is fabricated. While Krueger’s creator previously disclosed that ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was inspired by a legitimate news account, that account did not involve a real-life serial killer.
We rate this rumor Pants on Fire!"
4,"""We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world.""","on Friday, October 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/04/joe-biden/us-middle-class-no-longer-leads-world-bidens-claim/,Mostly True,Joe Biden,US middle class no longer leads the world? Biden’s claim mostly on targe,"Standing before thousands of Iowa voters, former Vice President Joe Biden recounted lessons from his salesman father about the dignity of work.
""He used to say, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community,"" Biden said Sept. 21 at the Steak Fry in hosted by Polk County Democrats in Des Moines. ""He would always end by saying it’s about being able to look your child in the eye and saying, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’""
That’s changed, according to Biden.
""Well, today a majority of the middle class can’t look their children in the eye. They don’t believe that they can say ‘it’s going to be okay.’ They don’t believe that their child will do as well as they did,"" he said in a speech. ""We have never ever had that happen in America. We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world.""
Biden’s remark about the middle class caught our ear at the Democratic event, so we decided to look into it.
Canada rising
Because there is no universally recognized definition of ""middle class,"" there are various ways to measure the data based on wealth and income. 
Biden’s claim tracks back to a 2014 article in the New York Times headlined ""The American Middle Class Is No Longer the World’s Richest."" 
It’s important to note that while Biden used the word ""wealthiest"" in his Iowa comment, the article — and most of the economic literature — has focused on income. Income refers to money earned in a period of time, such as a year, while wealth refers to the accumulation of past income and assets.
So they’re not exactly the same thing, but we’ll take a look at the studies on income as the best available approximation.
LIS, a group that maintains the Luxembourg Income Study Database, worked together with the New York Times’ Upshot team to examine data for household income from around the world. The article’s analysis used median income through 2010 as an indicator of the economic status of the middle class.
The new champion of middle class wealth, the article predicted, was Canada. The New York Times wrote that median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and that Canada had most likely surpassed it since then. Median incomes in Western Europe still trailed the United States, but the gap had narrowed.
The New York Times attributed the findings to a few factors: U.S. educational attainment rose more slowly than elsewhere in the industrialized world, U.S. companies distributed less profits to workers, and Americans received meager raises.
The data showed that when examining the 50th percentile of income, the United States was strongly ahead of other nations in 1980. But by 2010, Canada and Norway caught up to the United States.

Middle class data from other organizations
Other groups have worked on this middle-class comparison, with similar findings of a U.S. retreat. The Pew Research Center, for example, compared the United States with 11 Western European countries based on the median (after-tax) household income of each country.
In 2013, the national median disposable income for a three-person household in the United States was $52,195, behind Luxembourg ($65,293) and Norway ($57,031). (The income numbers were adjusted for differences in the cost of living across countries, using 2011 prices.)
In 1991, the United State and Luxembourg were considered equally on top. (The difference of a few hundred dollars is not statistically significant.)
However, comparing the median income in Luxembourg and the United States may not be an ideal comparison, because their economies and populations are so vastly different (600,000 Luxembourgians versus 327 million Americans). 
Another source on this question is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of about three dozen member countries that share internationally comparable data.
According to 2016 data used by the OECD, the United States had the fourth-largest median income among OECD countries behind Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland.
Using middle-class size, not wealth
Aside from wealth, economists also use size as a way to examine a country’s middle class.
OECD’s analysis on the middle class found that the share of people in the U.S. middle-income class — just over 50% — is much smaller than in most OECD countries. OECD defined middle class as 75-200 percent of median income.
OECD also found that the U.S. middle-income class has grown smaller with each successive decade.
Janet C. Gornick, a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center and director of the US Office of LIS, said that the middle class has hollowed out in several industrialized countries including the United States since the 1980s. The share of the middle class — defined as non-elderly households with income between half and twice the median income — shrunk by about 2 percentage points between 1985 and 2013 in the United States.
""Our middle class is getting lonely because a lot of people have exited that middle,"" Gornick said. ""In recent decades, some have exited the middle by moving up, and some have exited the middle because they moved down.""
When the middle class hollows out, the public can lose investments in public institutions and infrastructure such as schools, subways and even the electrical grid. The affluent can afford to send their children to private schools, hire private drivers or even use generators during power outages.
""If the middle class becomes very small — even if it’s comfortable — as there are fewer of them it is very threatening to the function of democracy,"" Gornick said.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""We’re no longer the wealthiest middle class in the world.""
A 2014 article in the New York Times, using solid data through 2010, found that Canadian median income tied the United States in 2010 and was likely to surpass it. Other data from Pew Research Center backs up the idea that the U.S. middle class now trails Norway and Luxembourg, when it used to at least be equally on top with the latter small country. 
Biden was imprecise in describing this as a change based on wealth, when the metrics were based on income. With that caveat, we rate this statement Mostly True."

""Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager, 3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, and the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on Trump, and the media was silent about all of it,"" Kirk wrote in the Sept 29 tweet.  
This is your daily reminder that:Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate TrumpAnd the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on TrumpAnd the media was silent about all of it🤔— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 29, 2019 
House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump after discovering he had urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election.
Kirk, Trump and other conservatives have tried pinning allegations of wrongdoing back on Democrats. During a Sept. 25 press conference, Trump charged that Democratic senators ""have actually done what they’re accusing me of doing, which I didn’t do.""
But what are the facts about these claims? 
We decided to break Kirk’s tweet down and see how each of his three claims stacked up to the facts. Put simply, all three are oversimplified and misleading.
""Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager""
This claim is unproven. We found no evidence that former President Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager. 
In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for Kirk pointed to opinion pieces in the Washington Post, Fox News and The Hill. According to one such article by The Hill’s John Solomon, investigators from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) met with U.S. officials in January 2016 to discuss coordinating their anti-corruption efforts.
Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian embassy official, told Solomon that Obama’s Justice Department asked the NABU officials during that meeting to revive a closed 2014 investigation of payments to Manafort by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who fled Ukraine in 2014 amid protests.
But Telizhenko — who worked at the embassy for less than a year, per the Washington Post — also said he could not remember if Manafort was specifically mentioned at the meeting.
Solomon also quoted Telizhenko and another Ukrainian official drawing a link between the January 2016 meeting and the release months later of a ledger showing off-the-books payments from Yanukovych’s political party to Manafort. 
Serhiy Leshchenko, the member of Ukraine's parliament and investigative journalist who revealed the existence of the ledger in a press conference, wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed that he was not working with the intent of helping Democrats.
""This was Leshchenko coming forward,"" said Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton. ""Nothing I have seen suggests that he did so at the request of the Obama White House.""
John Herbst, director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council and the former ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush, said the release of the ledger was not unusual: ""When the ledger came out, as someone who’s been watching Ukraine very closely for the last five years, that seemed to be an absolutely normal development given Ukraine’s own politics.""
Ukrainians were already attentive to Manafort because of his connections to Yanukovych, Herbst said. They became more interested once Manafort became part of the Trump campaign.
""I am a bit skeptical about the notion that you had Ukrainians meeting with the Justice Department to plot strategy on this thing,"" Herbst said. ""I can’t flatly tell you it’s wrong.""
Whatever was said, it’s also important to note that the alleged discussion happened in January 2016, while Trump didn’t hire Manafort to work on his campaign until March 2016. Manafort was named campaign chairman in May 2016.
Solomon did not respond to a request for comment but defended his work on Twitter. A spokesman for Obama declined to comment.
""3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate Trump"" 
This claim distorts what happened.
In May 2018, Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Bob Menendez of New Jersey wrote a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, prosecutor general of Ukraine, urging him to cooperate with former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation on Russian election interference.
Citing an article from the New York Times, the senators noted that Ukraine had reportedly stopped four investigations related to the Mueller probe for fear that the country’s cooperation could have jeopardized its ability to secure financial and military aid from the United States.
""If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation,"" they wrote.
The senators also asked if the Trump administration had encouraged Ukrainian officials to impede Mueller’s investigations in Ukraine. But they never asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, as Kirk falsely claimed. The senators clarified their intentions in a recent press release.
""This wasn’t about asking for an investigation, but to follow up on the New York Times report that the Ukraine prosecutor was ending his own ongoing investigations and not cooperating with queries from Mueller concerning Manafort,"" Leahy spokesman David Carle told PolitiFact.
""And the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on Trump""
This claim is misleading. It has its origins in a 2017 Politico report, which we’ve looked at before.
According to the report, a Ukrainian-American consultant for the Democratic National Committee looked for compromising information about Manafort and revealed some findings to officials at the Ukrainian embassy and the DNC.
But Kirk’s claim overstates the report’s findings. There’s no evidence that the DNC was working directly with Ukraine’s government.
The consultant, Alexandra Chalupa, told Politico that she had taken it upon herself to research Manafort’s connections to Yanukovych, the ousted former Ukrainian president. As Trump’s campaign surged, she started researching Trump’s ties to Russia, as well.
Chalupa shared some rumors and findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, the report said. The day after Trump hired Manafort, she told the DNC’s communications team about Manafort, Trump and their ties to Russia. Hacked emails also show her telling a DNC official a few months later that she had more information on Manafort.
The Politico report also said the DNC encouraged Chalupa to ask Ukrainian embassy staff if former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Yanukovych’s successor, would be willing to take a question from a reporter on Manafort’s hire and ties to Yanukovych.
But a former DNC staffer told Politico the DNC was ""not directing or driving her work.""
Chalupa took issue with the Politico article in a Facebook post. She told CNN she was not an opposition researcher and that the DNC never asked her to seek dirt from Ukraine. Multiple DNC and Clinton campaign officials also denied working with the Ukraine government.
Kenneth Vogel, one of the reporters behind the Politico story, clarified on Twitter that the ""DNC consultant was not repping DNC"" in her communications with Ukrainians.
Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the DNC, told PolitiFact that Chalupa was a part-time consultant hired to help the DNC ""engage in outreach to American ethnic communities.""
""The DNC’s contract with Chalupa permitted her to have other clients and/or engage in activities not on behalf of the DNC, which she presumably did,"" Watson said.
Our ruling
Kirk said, ""Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager, 3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, and the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on Trump, and the media was silent about all of it.""
Kirk’s three claims are all rooted in events or incidents that did transpire, but they oversimplify what happened in such a way that they give a misleading impression.

Red Bull did not respond to emails we sent asking about the post. 
But according to its website, the Red Bull energy drink contains caffeine, sugar, B-group vitamins and taurine, which it describes as ""an amino acid naturally occurring in the human body and present in the daily diet.""
A Q&A section on the website says that the drink is ""suitable for vegetarians"" because it uses only non-animal ingredients. It also addresses whether taurine is made from ""bull’s testicles."" It’s not.
Rather, the company says, it’s produced synthetically by pharmaceutical companies without animal products. Taurine is also found in food like scallops, fish and poultry, and most infant formulas, according to the company. 
In fact, taurine is in many animal tissues as well as plants. According to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes database of medical terminology, taurine derives its name from the Latin word ""taurus"" for bull. It was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin. 
Scientists have debunked the notion that energy drinks like Red Bull are made with taurine derived from animals. In July 2018, Joe Schwarcz, director of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, wrote that while scientists originally isolated taurine from bull semen, it’s now produced synthetically.
""This compound is an ‘aminosulfonic acid’ that is widely distributed in the human body and plays a role in cardiovascular function, development of the nervous system and formation of bile acids,"" he says in the post. .
Schwarcz warns that excessive consumption of energy drinks should be avoided, ""but not because of a concern that taurine is isolated from bull semen.""

As his visit to The Villages neared, Florida Democrats attacked Trump’s record on Medicare, suggesting he wants to weaken the health care program for the elderly. A Sept. 30 tweet from the state party about Trump's ""toxic record"" included a graphic that says ""$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump’s proposed 2020 budget.""
FACT: @realDonaldTrump is toxic for Florida. This week, in honor of Trump's visit, we will be sharing important facts from #TrumpsToxicRecord 👎 #flapol pic.twitter.com/gtp5wt9fI2— Florida Democrats (@FlaDems) September 30, 2019 
That statement is misleading. That is a projected reduction of future spending over a decade for the health care program for the elderly. And it’s worth noting that President Barack Obama called for trimming Medicare spending, too.
Trump’s proposed budget
The first thing to know about Trump’s 2020 budget proposal is that it is just an expression of Trump’s priorities and ideas. The changes proposed by Trump to slow down the growth in spending will only occur if Congress passes a law.
Medicare spending rises just about every year in Trump's budget proposal. Medicare is projected to grow by about $10 trillion over a decade.
The Medicare cost reduction under Trump’s budget is expected to be roughly $600 billion over the next 10 years, when compared to current spending levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis in May.
The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget largely agrees, saying Trump’s  budget proposal reduces Medicare spending by $515 billion or $575 billion. 
About 85% of the savings comes from reductions in what Medicare pays to providers.
""Those cuts would primarily reduce what Medicare pays providers, and I would not expect them to have negative effects on Medicare beneficiaries,"" Matt Fiedler, an economics fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, previously told PolitiFact. ""The budget’s Medicare proposals are also, in my view, largely sensible policy.""
Not all of the proposed cuts land on providers, however. 
Changes in Medicare’s Part D prescription drug insurance program might be the clearest example of Medicare cuts in the Trump budget that affect ordinary Americans. While one proposal would cap out-of-pocket costs for people with the very highest drug costs, another would expose people below that cost level to higher fees. At the end of the day, the Trump budget reduces payments for people who rely on prescription drugs by $50 billion. The idea of reducing the growth of Medicare isn’t new — and many of Trump’s ideas build upon ideas originally proposed in President Obama's budgets.
Obama’s last budget proposed trimming Medicare spending by $420 billion over 10 years. (Republicans accused Obama and Democrats of cutting Medicare many times, a claim we never rated better than Half True.)
Our ruling
The Florida Democratic Party tweeted ""$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump’s proposed 2020 budget.""
There is some truth to the attack. 
But the Democrats omit that the figure pertains to an amount of reduced spending over a decade. Also, it is a proposed reduction relative to projected future spending. Medicare spending will still rise overall. 
We rate this statement Half True."
4,"""If the impeachment reaches the house and passes to the senate and isn’t passed the first term is nullified and Trump can run two more terms.""","on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/oct/02/kaya-jones/donald-trump-third-term-failed-impeachment-would/,Pants on Fire!,Kaya Jones,"No, Donald Trump could not seek a third term if an impeachment trial failed | Pund","Singer and model Kaya Jones falsely claimed that if President Donald Trump is impeached but not removed from office, he could have the chance to serve an extra term in the White House.  
""Did you know that if the impeachment reaches the house and passes to the senate and isn’t passed the first term is nullified and Trump can run two more terms,"" Jones, a former band member of the Pussycat Dolls, wrote in an Oct. 1 tweet.
In a follow-up tweet, Jones, who describes herself on Twitter as being associated with Trump’s campaign advisory board, directed her followers to a thread on Quora, a question-and-answer website, about whether the results of a presidential election can be nullified.
That’s not how impeachment works, however. 
The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution prohibits presidents from being elected to office more than twice. The amendment reads:
""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.""
The basics of the impeachment process are spelled out in the Constitution. The House has ""the sole power of impeachment"" while the Senate reserves ""the sole power to try all impeachments."" When a president is tried in the Senate, the Constitution says ""the Chief Justice shall preside"" and a two-thirds vote is required to convict and remove the president from office.
The specific contours of the impeachment process have taken shape over time, as we noted in our in-depth analysis of what an impeachment inquiry against Trump could look like.
But the Constitution says nothing about a president’s term being ""nullified"" by a failed attempt at removal. If it did, then we might have seen former President Bill Clinton — who was impeached in the House but acquitted by the Senate — float the idea of running for a third term.
""That’s ridiculous,"" said Louis Seidman, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown Law, of Jones’s claim. ""There’s no truth to that whatsoever.""
Frank O. Bowman III, professor at the University of Missouri School of Law and the author of a book on impeachment, added that it was ""absolute rubbish."" 
""Under the 22nd Amendment, presidents get two terms, period (with a special exception if someone accedes to the office during the term of another president, but serves less than two years of that term),"" Bowman wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""Not the case for Trump.""
Jones did not respond to a request for comment.
Our ruling
Jones said ""if the impeachment reaches the house and passes to the senate and isn’t passed the first term is nullified and Trump can run two more terms.""
The Constitution explicitly prohibits presidents from getting elected to more than two terms.

4,"Since Israel started training teachers with guns, ""there have only been two school shootings in 44 years and both shooters were killed by teachers.""","on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/oct/02/viral-image/security-guards-are-armed-israeli-schools-not-teac/,False,Viral image,"Security guards are armed at Israeli schools, not teachers | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","As communities across the country grapple with school shootings, a widely-shared Facebook post suggests the United States should use Israel as a role model. 
""School shooting Israel 1974,"" the Aug. 13 post says. ""They began training teachers with guns. There have been only two school shootings in 44 years, and both shooters were killed by teachers. Have we learned anything yet, America?""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The post is both wrong about arming teachers, and wrong about how shooters were killed. Let’s break down the Facebook post’s claims. 
In 1974, more than 20 students were killed when Palestinian guerillas held students hostage in a school in Ma’alot, Israel. The Palestinians were killed ""in a bloody gun battle"" after Israeli soldiers raided the school building. 
But, as the Associated Press reported in 2012, Israel didn’t mandate armed guards at the entrances to all schools until 1995, more than two decades after the Ma’alot attack and two years after a Palestinian militant injured students and a principal in a knifing attack at a school.
That same article, which challenges a statement by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre that’s similar to the one in this Facebook post, notes that, in 2012, Israeli authorities could only recall two school shootings in the past four decades. 
In 2008, eight people, most of them teens, were killed when a Palestinian assailant attacked them at a nighttime study session at a Jewish religious seminary in Jerusalem. But that assailant was killed by an off-duty soldier who happened to be in the area, according to the AP — not a teacher. 
Searching this list kept by the Israel Ministory of Foreign Affairs of ""Palestinian terror and incitement"" since September 2000, another shooting happened in 2002 when three yeshiva high school students were killed at their Orthodox school by a Palestinian gunman before he was shot dead by a security guard — not a teacher. 
That’s because, by policy, teachers are not armed in Israeli schools, the Washington Post reported in February 2018. 
""Professionals deal with security,"" the Post quotes Amos Shavit, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Education, as saying. ""Not the teachers."" 
The newspaper notes that while school shootings are virtually unheard of in Israeli schools, that’s in large part because of the country’s efforts to combat terrorism, not the school shooters the United States has become familiar with. 
Shavit said the guards stationed at schools are under the authority of police, according to the Post, and in large cities law enforcement carry out security patrols around educational institutions during the school day. 
Israeli security experts also say gun violence is rare there because privately held guns are so rare, the Post story says. It quotes Simon Perry, a criminologist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, saying there is little opportunity for someone to carry out a gun attack inside a school. Though most people in Israel go into the military and receive some weapons training, he said, ""it is very, very hard to obtain a weapon in Israel.""

5,"""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years.""","on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/missouri/statements/2019/oct/02/sam-graves/missouris-aging-bridges-are-problem-maybe-not-reas/,Mostly True,Sam Graves,"Missouri’s aging bridges are a problem, but maybe not for the reasons you think | PolitiFact Missour","The Missouri Department of Transportation’s chronic lack of funding isn’t very surprising anymore. Just last November, Missouri voters rejected Proposition D, which would have increased the state’s gas tax by 10 cents and used the funds to boost spending on roads and bridges.


Without the additional funding, MoDOT counts on federal grant money to address infrastructure problems like the one posed by Missouri’s aging bridges.


In his Aug. 29 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., announced that MoDOT will receive a $20.7 million federal grant for the state’s bridge replacement program. To highlight the significance of the challenges, Graves said, ""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old—most were only designed to last for 50 years.""


The problem sounds severe and a little dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers hold up. To a degree, they do — Graves took the sentence from the MoDOT website.


But that doesn’t mean it’s time to panic every time you drive over a bridge.


How old is old?


MoDOT’s website confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years old. An average takes into account all bridges from newly built ones to those much older than 48 years.


So how old are Missouri’s oldest bridges? We don’t know.


State bridge engineer Dennis Heckman pointed out a lack of records before about 1900. About 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and might be even older.


Heckman explained that design life doesn’t mean a bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. Intended design life is not a set expiration date. In reality, it’s more like a sell-by date that indicates when a bridge’s quality needs to be monitored more closely.


""When they reach that age, you’re going to be maintaining them a lot more, fixing them a lot more,"" Heckman said. ""They just become a lot more high maintenance.""


There’s also some variation in the design life of Missouri’s bridges to take into account. For decades, Heckman said, a 50-year design life was standard, and about 8,000 of MoDOT’s 10,400 bridges have a design life of 50 years. In the past 10 to 15 years, designing bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; about 2,350 bridges were built to this standard. And longer, river-crossing bridges are built with a design life of 100 years. About 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design life category.


In total, 6,000, or 60%, of Missouri’s bridges are past their intended design life, and Heckman said MoDOT’s ability to extend the lifespan of these bridges is unique to each bridge and its specific conditions.


But bridge condition, not intended design life, is what determines MoDOT’s course of action.


Federal law requires all publicly owned highway bridges over 20 feet long to be inspected about once every two years, and currently, 909 of the bridges MoDOT inspects are rated ""poor"" by federal National Bridge Inspection Standards. Poor is the worst rating a bridge can receive and remain open for use.


Poor bridges result in weight limits that hinder economic development and reduce Missourians’ safety, Heckman said. ""Heavier trucks can’t use them. Farmers can’t use them when they’re hauling their grain or hogs to market. So you end up with a lot of detours."" He also said many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, firetruck, or ambulance.


Most states strive to have only about 3% to 4% of their bridges ranked poor, Heckman said. Currently, 9% of Missouri’s bridges are poor.


""At our current funding levels, we’re basically treading water,"" said Bob Brendel, MoDOT’s special assignments coordinator. ""We’re basically repairing and replacing about as many bridges every year as fall into the poor category.""


Our ruling


Graves said, ""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years.""


This statement comes directly from MoDOT’s data on state bridges, but it needs a bit of clarification. Most bridges don’t need to be replaced when they turn 50. That’s when engineers could expect them to need more maintenance. Condition, not design life, determines the death of a bridge. With that additional information, we rate the claim Mostly True"
5,"Says in the 2016 presidential election, ""I won that one by 42 points -- 42 points -- West Virginia.""","on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/west-virginia/statements/2019/oct/02/donald-trump/did-donald-trump-win-west-virginia-42-points-2016/,True,Donald Trump,Did Donald Trump win West Virginia by 42 points in 2016? | PolitiFact West Virgin,"At a rally in neighboring southwestern Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump trumpeted his wide 2016 presidential election victory in West Virginia.
""I won that one by 42 points -- 42 points -- West Virginia,"" Trump said during his Aug. 13 speech in Monaca, Pa. 
That would be a big win. Was his victory in the Mountaineer State that large? 
The Trump campaign pointed us to the official results on the website of the West Virginia Secretary of State, which showed that Trump won West Virginia with 68.63%, outpacing his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, with 26.48%. The difference is 42.15 percentage points -- right in tune with what Trump said.
West Virginia accounted for Trump’s second-widest margin of victory of any state, following Wyoming at 46.29%.
The 2016 results were also the latest sign of the widening of the gap between Republicans and Democrats in West Virginia, a state where Democrats were once dominant.
The following chart shows how Democratic margins of victory in the presidential race shrank between 1992 and 1996, then produced increasingly large Repubilcan margins of victory.

As the Pew Research Center has noted, this pattern has coincided with the increasing alignment of national partisan politics on certain demographic factors, notably race, educational attainment and population density.
Geographical areas that are less racially diverse, less college-educated and more rural have swung hard to the Republican Party in recent years, especially in federal-level elections. When Governing magazine recently analyzed all 50 states on these three demographic factors, it found that West Virginia had the strongest Republican-aligned demographics of any state.
Our ruling
Trump said that in the 2016 presidential election in West Virginia, he won by 42 points. He’s correct; in fact, it was his second-widest margin in any state, trailing only Wyoming. We rate the statement True."
5,"Siobhan Dunnavant ""wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.""","on Tuesday, October 1st, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/oct/01/rodman-debra/rodman-misstates-dunnavants-short-term-health-insu/,False,Rodman Debra,Rodman misstates Dunnavant's short-term health insurance bill | PolitiFact Virgin,"Del. Debra Rodman is telling voters that the quality of their health insurance is at risk if they re-elect Republican state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico.
""Sen. Dunnavant wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions,"" Rodman, a Democrat, says in a TV ad launched Sept. 20.
Rodman made the same charge on at least three glossy mailers she sent to voters in late September. One of them particularly got the ire of Dunnavant, a physician. ""What do you call a doctor who wrote a bill that would let insurers deny coverage for pre-existing conditions?"" it asks. Next to the words is a picture of a duck with the caption ""QUACK.""
Dunnavant told the Richmond Times-Dispatch it is a ""denigrating smear"" to be called a quack. And on her website, she called Rodman’s charges about her bill ""not accurate and completely misleading.""
So we fact-checked Rodman’s claim that Dunnavant wrote a bill that would let insurance companies to ""deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.""
Rodman backs her statement by citing a bill Dunnavant introduced in January 2018 that initially would have required health insurance companies doing business with the state government or municipalities to participate in Virginia’s health benefit exchange.
At Dunnavant’s request, the bill was amended. The provision she originally sought was replaced by a measure she said would conditionally change Virginia’s law for short-term health insurance policies.
Short-term plans provide low-cost, limited-duration insurance that doesn’t have to comply with the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. They don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions, prescriptions or maternity care and often come with high deductibles. Critics call them ""junk insurance.""
The Obama administration in 2016 issued a rule limiting short-term policies to 90 days to provide stop-gap policies to people who lost their health coverage and were waiting for enrollment periods to begin on the individual insurance market. Virginia’s insurance regulations were adjusted to the federal regulation.
President Donald Trump says the ACA is unconstitutional and should be abolished. In an effort to weaken the law, his administration announced in 2017 that it would change the rules on short-term policies to let them last for 364 days. 
Dunnavant’s amended bill - written with Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania - would have compelled Virginia to conform to the expected new federal regulation. Reeves said the lengthened policies would help Virginians without employer-provided insurance who had seen steep premium increases on their individual, ACA-compliant plans. 
In Virginia, the average premium for individual coverage in the ACA market is $796 a month, according to the State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Insurance. That’s twice the cost in 2016. In contrast, some short-term plans are advertised for $50 a month. 
Dunnavant’s amended bill passed the Senate unanimously. Democrats opposed the measure in the House, arguing the extended policies would encourage Virginians to drop their ACA-compliant coverage for low-cost, high-risk plans. The bill passed the House on a partisan 51-46 vote. Gov. Ralph Northan, a Democrat, vetoed the legislation.
In August 2018, the White House issued final rules that allow short-term plans to last 364 days and be renewed twice, meaning consumers could be insured by them for three years. In November, the state’s Bureau of  Insurance routinely conformed Virginia’s insurance regulations to the federal change without seeking General Assembly approval.
We repeat: State regulators adapted Virginia’s health insurance regulations to the federal change without General Assembly approval. State law allows the insurance bureau to do that. It’s standard practice, according to Ken Schrad, information director at the State Corporation Commission, which oversees the bureau.
In other words, Dunnavant’s and Reeves’ bill mandating the state to comply with changed federal regulations expanding short-term policies was unnecessary.
""These are federal decisions,"" said Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans. ""The state doesn’t have a great role in controlling Obamacare.""
All of this undermines Rodman’s claim that Dunnavant ""wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" Virginia insurers were already allowed to write 90-day short-term policies omitting pre-existing conditions and more. Dunnavant’s bill would have superfluously extended the period to 364-days to match expected new federal rules.
Rodman’s claim also lacks perspective: It suggests that any Virginian could be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions when, in fact, the regulation will affect few. About 79 percent of Virginians are insured by ACA-complaint plans - subsidized by their employers or the government with mandated coverage for pre-existing conditions, accoording SCC data. 
The remaining 21% percent is the pool most likely to consider short-term term insurance. Are those who opt in being ""denied"" pre-existing coverage, as Rodman contends, or making a free choice? We’ll leave that call to you.
Our ruling
Rodman misleadingly claims Dunnevant ""wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" 
Dunnavant opposes Obamacare. She sponsored an unsuccessful bill in 2018 that would have expanded inexpensive, short-term health insurance policies that don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions and many other medical circumstances. They are exempt from Obamacare standards. 
But contrary to Rodman’s claim, Dunnavant’s bill wouldn’t have ""let"" insurance companies sell short-term plans, they were already permitted to sell 90-day policies in Virginia in accordance with ACA rules. Dunnevant’s bill would have extended the coverage period to 364 days to comply with expected new federal rules - something the state regulators automatically do. would have done.
Rodman’s statement also suggests that anyone could have been denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. In fact, 79 percent of Virginians have ACA-compliant insurance, subsidized by their employers or the government, that mandates such coverage.
We rate Rodman’s dramatic claim False."
5,"""More than half of death row prisoners are people of color.""","on Tuesday, October 1st, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/01/gwen-moore/state-lawmaker-hits-target-claim-racial-background/,True,Gwen Moore,Wisconsin lawmaker hits the target with claim on racial background of death row prisoners | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Wisconsin was one of the first states to abolish capital punishment, on July 10, 1853. 
The move followed the 1851 execution of John McCaffary, the first and last person to be executed under Wisconsin state law.
More than 2,000 people witnessed the execution by hanging of McCaffary in Kenosha. He had received the death penalty for drowning his wife, Bridgett McCaffary, on July 23, 1850, in a backyard cistern. The hanging turned into a gruesome spectacle, as McCaffary struggled on the end of the rope for some 20 minutes as he was slowly strangled, according to the MurderPedia.org website. The uproar over the slow public strangulation of McCaffary prompted Wisconsin to ban the death penalty.  
While there is no death penalty in Wisconsin, the issue resonates nationwide -- particularly since the Trump administration moved in July 2019 to reinstate the federal death penalty. 
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., slammed the reinstatement in a July 26, 2019 tweet:
""The death penalty is a discriminatory policy. More than half of death row prisoners are people of color. The Trump administration isn’t fooling anyone by reinstating the federal death penalty and executing a white supremacist first. Distraction & deflection is their goal.""
Is Moore right that ""more than half of death row prisoners are people of color""?
Establishing the terms
Before we jump in, some background on the issue.
As of August 28, 2019, there are 30 states that currently allow the death penalty. They include Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Texas and Utah. Most of the death penalty states are in the west and south, with the nearest ones to Wisconsin being Indiana, Ohio and Kansas. Capital punishment was abolished in Illinois in 2011. 
All told, some 2,700 people are on death row at the state level. A little more than 60 are in federal prisons awaiting the death penalty.
Meanwhile, according to a March 30, 2014, National Public Radio article, ""The Journey from ’Colored’ to ‘Minorities’ to ‘People of Color,’"" the definition of ""person of color"" has varied over the years.
""In U.S. history, ‘person of color’ has often been used to refer only to people of African heritage,"" the article states. ""Today, it usually covers all/any peoples of African, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, Asian or Pacific Island descent, and its intent is to be inclusive.""
With that in mind, how does Moore’s death-row claim stack up?
The evidence
When asked to back up the claim, Moore’s staff referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to two reports. 
The first is a September 2011 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, ""Race and the Death Penalty."" It asserted that ""People of color have accounted for a disproportionate 43% of total executions since 1976 and 55% of those currently awaiting execution."" 
The second report Moore’s office cited was from the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, that provides legal representation to prisoners.
Its report also said more than half of the people on state death rows in the United States are people of color: ""Of the more than 2,700 people currently under a death sentence, 42 percent are black, 13 percent are Hispanic, and 42 percent are white.""
The data in the Equal Justice Initiative report came from a May 31, 2019, report from the Death Penalty Information Center, which compiled data from the death penalty states and found that as of May 2019, there are 2,721 inmates on death row.
It included the same racial statistics cited by the Equal Justice Initiative, but with an additional 3% listed as ""other."" 
Those reports, however, only cover state-level death penalty cases.

Federal data
To get a handle on the makeup of federal prisoners, we turned to the Death Penalty Information Center, which is a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization that provides the media and the public with analysis and information about capital punishment.
As of April 1, 2019, it found there were 62 inmates with the following racial background:
White -- 27 (43.5%)
Black -- 26 (41.9%)
Latino -- 7 (11.3%)
Native American -- 1 (1.6%) 
Asian -- 1 (1.6%)
So, people of color make up a majority of death row inmates at both the state and federal levels.
Our ruling
Moore said  ""More than half of death row prisoners are people of color.""  
Reports from organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Equal Justice Initiative and the Death Penalty Information Center confirm the death row racial population claim, both at the state and federal level. 
We rate her claim True."
5,"""Our WV highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, up 20 spots from last year’s ranking!

Jim Justice sought to tout his record on improving the state’s highways.
""Our WV highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, up 20 spots from last year’s ranking!"" Justice tweeted Aug. 22. ""This ranking affirms all the hard work we’ve done, and that we continue to do, fixing our state’s roads.""

Let’s take a closer look at the source of his assertion. (Justice’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.)
Justice’s tweet linked to a news release from the governor’s office that cited the source of the rankings as the Reason Foundation’s 24th annual highway report. The Reason Foundation has a libertarian perspective, including individual liberty and free markets, the foundation’s website says.
The annual highway study uses spending and performance data that state agencies send to the federal government. To do this, it ranks the 50 states in 13 categories, such as highway expenditures per mile, pavement conditions, congestion, bridge conditions and fatality rates.
Looking at the overall state figures, West Virginia does rank 16th in the country, a rise of 20 notches from 36th in the previous year’s survey. 
Compared to its neighbors, the report finds West Virginia slightly ahead of Ohio (18th) and Maryland (39th) in overall ranking but behind Virginia (2nd). West Virginia is doing worse than some regionally comparable states like Kentucky (5th) but better than others such as Indiana (33rd).
The top overall state was North Dakota, and the worst was New Jersey. Read the full list here. 
Some caveats
It should be noted that West Virginia’s 16th-place overall ranking obscures some aspects of the report that paint a less rosy picture of the state’s highways.
For starters, the bulk of the highway data in the most recent report covers 2016,which is before Justice took office. Only two categories out of 13 use 2017 data, when he had begun his first term.
So while this report represents a positive development for West Virginia, it doesn’t fully reflect Justice’s own policies, as he implied when he referred to ""all the hard work we’ve done.""
In addition, a technical change in the report’s methodology played a role in West Virginia’s increase. According to the report’s summary of the state’s rankings, West Virginia ""benefited from the report no longer measuring narrow rural arterial lanes,"" a category where the state ranked 50th last year.
Finally, looking only at the overall ranking, as Justice does, obscures some relatively weak ratings for West Virginia on key sub-categories.
Notably, the state ranks 36th in its overall fatality rate, 48th in structurally deficient bridges, 20th in urban Interstate pavement condition and 21st in rural Interstate pavement condition. 
The state scored better on cost measures, ranking second in total spending per mile and third in capital and bridge costs per mile. 
""To improve in the rankings, West Virginia needs to reduce its percentage of structurally deficient bridges and its rural arterial pavement condition,"" Feigenbaum told PolitiFact West Virginia. ""The state is in the bottom five for structurally deficient bridges and the bottom 15 for rural arterial pavement condition in the country.""
Our ruling
Justice tweeted, ""Our WV highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, up 20 spots from last year’s ranking! This ranking affirms all the hard work we’ve done, and that we continue to do, fixing our state’s roads.""
Justice has a point about the overall number, but his celebratory tone is somewhat exaggerated. Most of the data reflects a period before he became governor, and a major reason for the increase came from the elimination of a category from the previous year’s report in which West Virginia ranked 50th nationally. 
The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True."

Here, we’ll fact-check whether the United States is ""#1 in oil consumption"" in the world, since international comparisons of data on oil use are more consistent than for many of the other comparisons Ojeda made.
Ojeda told PolitiFact West Virginia that he found his information through Wikipedia. We turned to original sources.
Measured by total oil consumption, the United States does rank first in the world, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, a comprehensive review of data on global energy.
In 2018, the United States consumed 20,456,000 barrels a day -- far beyond the second-place nation, China, with 13,525,000 barrels a day.
However, it’s worth noting that using the overall consumption figure is an imperfect method for measuring global oil consumption
Oil consumption ""is related to two factors -- high consumption and population size,"" said Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. 
Because larger countries will usually have larger totals than smaller countries, it’s also important to look at per capita consumption -- consumption divided by population.
By this measure, the United States is near the top, but it isn’t quite No. 1.
According to calculations by Eni, an Italian oil company, the United States ranked third internationally in per capita oil consumption. Saudi Arabia ranked first with 34.91 barrels a year, followed by Canada with 24.16 barrels and the United States with 23.12 barrels.
Our ruling
Ojeda said the United States is ""#1 in oil consumption"" in the world. That’s correct for total consumption, but that’s partly because of the United States’ large population. On a per capita basis, the United States ranks third behind Saudi Arabia and Canada.

But some have used the kingpin’s high-profile trial to fuel viral misinformation on the internet. 
We came across one of those rumors in a Facebook post, which claimed ""El Chapo stated in court"" that former FBI director James Comey ""helped launder $150m cartel money for Pelosi."" The post continued, saying, ""it appears only those who were at the trial are aware of this. Maybe more people should bring this into the news.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This is just one variation of the many rumors that claim Guzmán gave up information during his testimony in the trial. 
Like the others, it is completely fabricated because Guzmán didn’t take the stand at all during his trial. 
According to the trial’s transcript and several media reports, Guzmán chose not to testify at the trial and his defense only called one witness, FBI agent Paul Roberts. The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzmán, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies between the notes and the testimony the trafficker gave during the trial. 
Alex Cifuentes, a former Guzmán associate, took the stand and testified that, among other Mexican officials paid off by Guzmán, former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about Comey, Pelosi, or any other American official.
Our ruling
A post on Facebook says Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán took the stand and said James Comey helped launder $150 million ""cartel money"" for Nancy Pelosi.
This claim is unfounded. EGuzmán did not take the stand at his trial, and therefore could not have testified that his cartel gave millions to Comey, Pelosi or any American official. 
This rumor is Pants on Fire!"
5,"""Longstanding whistleblower rules (were changed) just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report.""","on Tuesday, October 1st, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-about-change-whistleblow/,False,Donald Trump,Donald Trump’s false claim about a change in whistleblower rules,"President Donald Trump raised the specter of shady bureaucratic doings that allowed a whistleblower’s complaint to move forward when ordinarily it wouldn’t have.
""Who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report?"" Trump tweeted Sept. 30. ""Drain the swamp!""
WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019 
Trump was far from the only one saying the rules were changed ""just before"" the report that ignited an impeachment inquiry was filed Aug. 12. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted the same thing Sept. 28.
""Whistleblowers were required to provide direct, first-hand knowledge of allegations,"" McCarthy wrote. ""But just days before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward, the IC (Inspector General of the Intelligence Community) secretly removed that requirement from the complaint form."" Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani echoed the same point Sept. 29.
All three tweets lead back to the same article on the conservative website Federalist. 
All three are wrong. 
• First-hand knowledge by a whistleblower has never been required since the law protecting intelligence community whistleblowers was enacted.
• Inspector General staff, who investigate a charge, need first-hand information to move a complaint forward — as they did in this case.
• The current complaint was based on both first- and second-hand information.
The Federalist article
The Sept. 27 article claimed, ""Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.""
The evidence comes from a tweet thread started by Stephen McIntyre on the morning the Federalist article appeared. McIntyre is a former mining company director who created the Climate Audit blog, which questions the official data behind climate change.
From the thread, a few key points emerge:
As of May 24, 2018, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community’s Urgent Concern disclosure form — the form whistleblowers fill out  — offered three choices to describe how the whistleblower got his/her information: personal knowledge, heard from other people, and other sources.

The current form offers just two choices: personal knowledge or ""heard about it from others."" That form dates from August 2019.

The previous form also included a section under the subhead ""First-hand information required.""
""In order to find an urgent concern ‘credible,’ the IC IG (Intelligence Community Inspector General) must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA (Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act) based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when a fellow employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing. (Anyone with first-hand knowledge of the allegations may file a disclosure in writing directly with the IC IG.) Similarly, speculation about the existence of wrongdoing does not provide sufficient basis to meet the statutory requirements of the ICWPA. If you think wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions, IC IG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA.""
The current reporting form lacks that section.
Based on these facts, Trump and other Republicans asserted that the rules for whistleblowers were changed ""just before"" the current complaint was filed. Actually, only the forms were changed. The rules stayed the same.
The actual sequence
The whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry filled out the earlier version of the form, and no rules were changed.
The Office of Inspector General issued a statement Sept. 30 saying that ""the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019, is the same form the IC IG has had in place since May 24, 2018.""
The inspector general’s office underscored that the whistleblower received the section about the need for first-hand evidence before a claim would go on to the next step.
So changes to the form took place after the whistleblower filed.
As for the rules on what is required, those have been the same since 2014 under an order issued by the Director of National Intelligence. Intelligence Community Directive 120 defines a protected disclosure as one that the employee ""reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule or regulation.""
The statement from the Inspector General’s office emphasized the reasonable belief standard.
""By law the Complainant – or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees – need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint,"" the statement said. ""The IC IG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law.""
The section about the need for first-hand information has to do with the investigation that follows a whistleblower’s report, not a requirement for the report itself.
""This is their way of tempering the whistleblower’s expectations,"" said analyst Irvin McCullough, with the nonprofit Government Accountability Project. (McCullough’s father served as inspector general until 2017 and now represents the whistleblower.) ""It says we might not find enough to support your complaint.""
The latest IG statement says it changed its forms after the current affair unfurled, because it understood some parts ""could be read — incorrectly — as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint.""
The statement noted that the whistleblower checked both boxes to indicate he/she had both first and second-hand information. 
It also notes that its investigation found the report credible and urgent.
The White House had no comment.
Our ruling
Trump said, ""Longstanding whistleblower rules (were changed) just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report.""
The current rules have been in place since 2014. Whistleblowers can provide either first or second-hand information, or both. The current whistleblower filled out a form that dates from May 2018. Whatever changes existed on that form date from 14 months before the present claim was filed.
Investigators require more than second-hand information in order to move a complaint forward, but that is not a requirement before a complaint can be filed.
The Inspector General’s office changed its forms after the whistleblower filed, but those changes had no bearing on the rules under which a claim would be processed.
We rate this claim False."
5,"Says Pat McCrory ""shepherded in driver’s licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.""","on Monday, September 30th, 2019",http://politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2019/sep/30/michelle-malkin/did-pat-mccrory-help-immigrants-get-drivers-licens/,Mostly False,Michelle Malkin,Did Pat McCrory help immigrants get driver's licenses? | PolitiFact North Carolin,"A conservative pundit called out former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory for taking a liberal stance on immigrants’ access to driver’s licenses.
During a recent appearance on Fox’s The Ingraham Angle, Laura Ingraham and Michelle Malkin discussed Republican Dan Bishop’s victory in the 9th Congressional District race. Malkin praised Bishop for his commitment to the conservative agenda and suggested that other Republicans had gone astray. She said, ""It was a previous North Carolina governor who was a Republican who shepherded in driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.""
Malkin is a political blogger, commentator, and author whose work focuses on immigration and corruption. She appeared on the show to discuss her new book, ""Open Borders Inc.: Who's Funding America's Destruction?"" 
Her claim seemed fishy to us for a few reasons. First, the state didn’t have a Republican governor until over a decade after 9/11. Also, North Carolina isn’t among the 14 states and territories that allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get a driver’s license. There’s actually a bill in the General Assembly to do this, but it hasn’t passed.
So, we decided to look into her claim and found there was little to support it. 
We assume she was talking about former Governor Pat McCrory, because he was the only Republican to hold the office since 9/11. During his term, DACA recipients became eligible for driver’s licenses. However, McCrory opposed allowing immigrants living in the country illegally to get drivers’ licenses. It’s quite a stretch for Malkin to say he ""shepherded in"" those privileges.
Limitations on driver’s licenses for immigrants in NC
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to make immigrants living in the country illegally eligible for driver’s licenses, according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures in July 2019. North Carolina is not one of them.
That wasn’t always the case. In the 1990s and early 2000s, those immigrants could get driver’s licenses in North Carolina. In a New York Times article from August 2001, Wayne Hurder, the state’s director of driver’s license certification, explained the reasoning behind the policy.
''We think it's in the best interests of everyone in the state if we can get them to learn the laws of the road and get insurance. It's not our job to get into national immigration policy — this is a purely practical decision,"" Hurder said at the time. 
But in response to 9/11, Congress launched several efforts to strengthen domestic security. The REAL ID Act of 2005 mandated states to require proof of citizenship for REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards. REAL IDs are required by federal agencies for people who want to access federal facilities, board federally-regulated airplanes, and enter nuclear power plants. The law is being phased in with a final deadline in October 2020.
In 2005, then-Governor Mike Easley, a Democrat, followed the mandate and signed a law that specified driver’s license applicants must provide a valid Social Security Number, which prevented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from getting licenses. Before then, applicants could provide an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead. 
In recent years, a group of Democratic state representatives have been pushing another bill called the Safer Roads and Communities Act. It also would enable those immigrants to get licenses. The bill’s supporters argue that if more drivers are trained and insured, roads will be safer for everyone.
DACA recipients are eligible 
We reached out to Malkin about her claim but did not hear back. It seems likely that she was referring to a policy change in 2013 to allow immigrants who qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to get North Carolina driver’s licenses. (They are a small subset of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, accounting for about 15%.)
Pat McCrory, who is the only Republican governor since 9/11, was in office at the time. Neither the REAL ID Act of 2005 nor the recent bills in the General Assembly were in play during his term.
DACA was a program established under President Barack Obama that would defer deportation for ""Dreamers"" — young immigrants who illegally entered the United States as children — who met certain criteria. Immigrants with the new status could apply for a Social Security card and legally work in the United States.
But the North Carolina DMV wasn’t sure how to handle driver’s license applications from DACA recipients and asked the attorney general’s office to weigh in. In January 2013, then Attorney General Roy Cooper released a legal opinion that said DACA recipients were entitled to driver’s licenses.
When we asked McCrory about the policy, he emphasized that the driver’s licenses issued to DACA recipients included the phrases ""Legal Presence"" and ""No Lawful Status."" The former governor said, ""We were following the law reluctantly.""
McCrory also told us that he opposed expanding driver’s license eligibility to immigrants living here illegally. When a 2015 bill was introduced that proposed to do just that, McCrory’s legislative liaison told lawmakers, ""He is concerned with the provision providing driving privileges to those who are in this country unlawfully.""
Our ruling
Michelle Malkin said former Republican Governor Pat McCrory ""shepherded in driver’s licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.""
For the most part, her claim isn’t supported by the facts.
North Carolina hasn’t allowed unauthorized immigrants to get driver’s licenses since 2006, when a Democratic governor signed an act requiring driver’s license applicants to provide a valid Social Security Number. We found widely varying estimates on the number of people living in North Carolina illegally who are currently ineligible for driver’s licenses.
Although North Carolina decided to allow DACA recipients to access driver’s licenses during McCrory’s tenure as governor, he said he followed that ""reluctantly"" and did not support making the larger population of immigrants living here illegally eligible for driver’s licenses. 
We rate the claim Mostly False.

5,"Says Republican Gov. Phil Scott ""just voted to impeach President Trump.""","on Monday, September 30th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/30/facebook-posts/no-vermonts-governor-did-not-vote-impeach-donald-t/,False,Facebook posts,"No, Vermont’s governor did not vote to impeach Donald Trump | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","It is not true that Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott ""just voted"" to impeach President Donald Trump, as a Facebook post claims.
""Hi I’m Vermont Republican Phil Scott. I just voted to impeach President Trump,"" said a Sept. 27 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 5,000 times.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Facebook post is wrong on several accounts: a governor has no voting role in impeachment proceedings, there hasn’t been a vote to impeach Trump, and the governor didn’t even say Trump should be impeached.
What has Scott said or done? Below is the background provided by Rebecca Kelley, the governor’s communications director.
On Sept. 25, Scott’s office received an inquiry from the Associated Press asking for comment regarding the impeachment inquiry against Trump formally announced Sept. 24 by U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Scott’s office sent the Associated Press a statement which in part said, ""we have much more to learn and need to understand all the facts as this serious allegation is considered. It appears Congress will be starting an inquiry process, which I believe is appropriate."" Impeachment shouldn’t be taken lightly or abused, Scott’s statement said, adding that he hoped Congress would be objective and transparent in their process.
On Sept. 26, the governor at his pre-scheduled weekly press conference again was asked about the impeachment inquiry. VTDigger.org reported that Scott said he supported the inquiry, but hoped it would be driven by facts, not politics.
""I think this is Congress’ responsibility and, again, let the facts determine the course of action moving forward,"" Scott said, according to VTDigger.org’s reporting. ""When we see the facts, when I see the facts, I’d be happy to comment on that when it happens. I don’t want to get ahead of this.""
Kelley emphasized to PolitiFact that Scott’s comments have been on the inquiry process and that he’s said that the outcome should not be predetermined, but fact-based.
So the Facebook post takes a step ahead of what Scott has said about the inquiry process to inaccurately claim that he ""just voted"" to impeach Trump.
The Facebook post additionally ignores the facts that impeachment-related votes involve the U.S. Congress, not state governors. The House also has yet to cast a vote on impeachment. (Read our story on how the impeachment process works.)
Our ruling
A Facebook post says Scott ""just voted to impeach President Trump.""
Scott has not done that. As Vermont’s governor, Scott cannot vote on this issue. Impeachment proceedings are a matter of Congress, not state governors. Scott says he supports a fact-based impeachment inquiry and that he’d comment on the topic once he sees the related facts. He has not said Trump should be impeached.
We rate the Facebook post False."
5,"""49% of all new income goes to the top 1%.""","on Sunday, September 29th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/sep/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-49-new-income-goes-top-1/,Mostly True,Bernie Sanders,Bernie Sanders says 49% of ‘new’ income goes to the top 1% | PolitiFact Illinois,"Speaking to a crowd of Chicago Teachers Union members as they considered a strike over contract demands, presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders riffed on the theme for which he is perhaps best known: economic inequality.
Sanders told the cheering crowd that, if elected, he plans to pay for his many proposals — including making public colleges and universities tuition-free and wiping out student debt — with his recently proposed wealth tax.
He said this is ""a time of massive and grotesque income and wealth inequality in America.""
""49% of all new income goes to the top 1%,"" Sanders said while ticking off his usual talking points on the gap between the nation’s richest and everyone else — some of which we’ve checked before — and promising that if he is elected, ""the billionaire class and the large, profitable corporations will start paying their fair share of taxes.""
While mulling a presidential run in early 2015, Sanders used a considerably more stark version of the same claim, contending almost all income growth at the time was going to the top 1%. We rated that Mostly True, finding Sanders had accurately represented a somewhat limited, though widely cited research study based on federal tax data.
But the discrepancy between Sanders’ new figure — which refers to income growth — and the one from a few years ago gave us pause, so we decided to take a closer look. It turns out his latest statement relates to an updated edition of the same study. Once again, he cited it accurately. Just like last time, however, there are several caveats worth keeping in mind.
Different ways to assess income
Sanders based his claim on the latest update to a study from Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who uses pre-tax income reported in Internal Revenue Service filings to compare top income dating back to 1913. As Saez’s report notes, it’s the only data source that stretches back that far.
In his March update, Saez highlights his finding that average inflation-adjusted family income grew by 14% from 2009 to 2017, the latest year for which IRS data is available. But growth in the wake of the Great Recession was uneven, he notes, with the incomes of the top 1% rising 38% while the incomes of the bottom 99% grew only 8.7%.
""Hence, the top 1% captured 49% of the income gains during this recovery period,"" Saez concluded. That backs up the figure Sanders used.
But Saez’s work does not include income received from government programs such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment compensation, or health insurance benefits. Other studies that do account for these significant income factors, along with after-tax income — including one performed by Saez — suggest a more narrow gap in income growth.
Because Saez’s calculations are based on pre-tax income, his work doesn’t account for the other way in which the federal government redistributes earnings — by requiring the wealthy to pay a heftier share in taxes. That’s particularly relevant here, given that Sanders was speaking about the need to hike taxes on the very rich.
""If you want to have a comprehensive measure of how Americans pay their bills, we’ve got to add all sources of income and we have to subtract the taxes that are taken out of our pay before we even get it,"" said economist Gary Burtless, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
In a report published last year, Urban Institute economist Stephen Rose surveyed a collection of recent studies on income inequality, highlighting how differences in methodology ""greatly affect findings"" and identifying the Saez series Sanders cited as the clear outlier.
The Saez report Sanders drew from also takes as its starting point the end of one of the nation’s worst economic slumps. Experts told us that’s an important point to keep in mind because the country’s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession, meaning the gains they registered during the first few years of the recovery as the stock market began to bounce back were especially large but are now growing more slowly by comparison.
Our ruling
Sanders said ""49% of all new income goes to the top 1%.""
That’s a reference to growth in pre-tax, pre-government benefit income during the economic recovery following the Great Recession from 2009 to 2017, which was calculated by one of the leading experts in the field of income inequality research.
However, it’s not the only way to measure income, and other economists we spoke with pointed to more comprehensive, though slightly more dated, studies that compare income growth after accounting for what people pay to and receive from the government.
We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True.

MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

5,Says a photo shows Greta Thunberg posing next to George Soros and with ISIS.,"on Friday, September 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/27/facebook-posts/greta-thunberg-did-not-pose-isis-or-george-soros/,False,Facebook posts,Greta Thunberg did not pose with ISIS or George Soros | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"On social media, some users are sharing misinformation about the 16-year-old activist who inspired the worldwide climate strike Sept. 20.
One post, which was published on Facebook on Sept. 23, claims to include three photos of Greta Thunberg. It purports to show the Swedish teenager posing with an Islamic State member, philanthropist George Soros and an Antifa shirt. ""Well well well … do I need to explain anymore?"" reads text above the images, followed by the hashtags, ""#AnonsKnew #GretaThunberg #DeepStatePuppet.""
A Facebook user who shared the post wrote next to the image, ""This is Typical Twisted Lies and Deceit, the Stupid Left Believes these Idiots!""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And versions of it have been shared hundreds of times, so we wanted to see if the photos are real.
 
Based on our analysis, only one of the photos in the Facebook post is authentic — the other two are doctored or taken out of context. And the caption over the real one, which shows Thunberg wearing an antifascist shirt, isn’t accurate.
The ISIS photo
The first image in the flagged post is a screenshot of another post from a Facebook user. It claims to show Thunberg posing with a bearded member of the Islamic State, the man’s arm around her shoulder as he speaks into a microphone.
But the photo is not of Thunberg. A reverse image search reveals that the image is six years old and was taken from a video made during an ISIS-led Quran recitation competition in Aleppo, Syria, according to a news caption, as we noted in a previous fact check.
The photo was published in a now-defunct article on an Iranian website in August 2014. And The Morocco World News reported around the same time that the girl in the video was 7 years old, tearful over mistakes she made in her recitation. While the child looks vaguely similar to Thunberg — who would have been 10 at the time — there’s no evidence that it’s her.
The Soros photo
The second image in the flagged Facebook post purports to show Thunberg posing next to Soros, a philanthropist and Democratic donor who is often the target of conservative attacks.
But we found that the photo was digitally altered to make it look like Thunberg is chummy with the wealthy liberal financier. The original image actually shows Thunberg posing with former Vice President Al Gore in December.
Thank you @algore for being a true pioneer. Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you. #climatecrisis #climatebreakdown pic.twitter.com/HzbvPcGkwu— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) December 30, 2018 
The altered version of the image appears to have been created by a French parody outlet in late August.
The Antifa photo
The final photo in the suspect Facebook post shows Thunberg sitting on a couch while wearing a shirt that says ""antifascist all stars."" Text written over the image claims that the activist ""aligns herself with the Antifa terrorist organization.""
Antifa is a loosely-affiliated group of left-wing activists whose mission is to counter the ideology of fascism. It has drawn criticism for its members’ willingness to use violence against far-right groups.
The photo of Thunberg is real. On July 26, she tweeted that she had deleted a photo of herself wearing the shirt after learning that it could be linked to ""a violent movement.""
However, in the same tweet, she said the shirt was borrowed.
Yesterday I posted a photo wearing a borrowed T-shirt that says I’m against fascism. That T-shirt can apparently to some be linked to a violent movement. I don’t support any form of violence and to avoid misunderstandings I’ve deleted the post. And of course I am against fascism.— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) July 26, 2019 
We could find no evidence that Thunberg has participated in Antifa demonstrations. And being antifascist does not necessarily mean one supports the left-wing group Antifa.
What’s more, the Facebook post’s claim that Antifa is a terrorist organization is dubious. The Central Intelligence Agency has not included the group on its list of such organizations, although some lawmakers have called for it to be. However, in the past, some officials in the intelligence community have called Antifa members ""domestic terrorists"" in confidential documents.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims to show Greta Thunberg posing with ISIS, George Soros and an Antifa shirt.
The first photo was taken out of context and doesn’t show Thunberg at all. The second photo was digitally altered. The third is genuine, but Thunberg has said she borrowed the shirt at the time. Also, being antifascist is not the same as being a member of Antifa.
The post is inaccurate. We rate it False."

One post claimed several of the senators running for president in 2020 had not passed any of the dozens of bills they had introduced.
""In Congress, Elizabeth Warren introduced 110 bills. 2 passed. Cory Booker introduced 120 bills. 0 passed,"" the Sept. 12 post reads. ""Kamala Harris introduced 54 bills. 0 passed. Bernie Sanders never held a job until age 53. He lived off of welfare and four different women.""
The Facebook post, which was actually a screenshot of a tweet, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It’s a common strategy to attack politicians for their legislative records. And the post has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, so we wanted to check it out. It’s worth mentioning that it doesn’t include an assertion about Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. — the other senator vying for president.
The tweet screenshotted in the Facebook post was originally published by Mark Simone a little after midnight on March 14. Simone is a conservative talk show host on WOR, a radio station based in New York City. We reached out to Simone for the sources behind his tweet, but we haven’t heard back.
The post is inaccurate and paints an incomplete picture of the politicians’ effectiveness.
Tweet misconstrues the legislative record
For this fact-check, we first used the most stringent definition of the word ""passed"" — legislation that is signed by the president — to assess the validity of this post. Then we looked at how many of the senators’ bills had passed at least the Senate. We looked at each senator’s record at the time of Simone’s tweet to find out.
Below are their records as of March 13, the last business day before the original post, according to GovTrack, a website that keeps tabs on congressional legislation.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.
Introduced: 113
Passed Senate: 1
Signed by president: 2
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.
Introduced: 56
Passed Senate: 2
Signed by president: 0
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Introduced: 108
Passed Senate: 2
Signed by president: 0
Those numbers are close but not exactly to what Simone shared. Harris had introduced slightly more legislation than the radio host claimed in his tweet, while Booker and Warren had introduced slightly less. It’s possible that Simone used a separate source that counted each senator’s bills differently. But we don’t know for sure since he did not get back to us.
However, all the senators had introduced legislation that had passed at least the Senate as of March 13. Booker even had two bills signed into law by President Barack Obama. So it’s inaccurate to say that none of them had any of their bills passed as of March 13. It’s even more inaccurate to repost that claim on Facebook six months after it was originally made.
Finally, some experts doubt the premise of counting how many bills lawmakers have proposed.
""Sponsoring bills is a very limited and often questionable way of judging effectiveness,"" said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, in an email. ""Much key legislating now is done in omnibus bills, where much is done through amendments. Divided government shuts out minority lawmakers, especially now in this tribal era.""
""There are many, many other ways of being effective.""
For instance, the Boston Globe reported in 2018 on a dozen or so examples Warren can point to in which she worked with Republicans to get bills to Trump’s desk. 
""She introduced legislation with GOP Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to make hearing aids available over-the-counter, for example.

Booker, meanwhile, is credited with helping pass the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that was signed into law by Trump. Booker was a co-sponsor on the legislation, which reversed harsh drug sentencing guidelines adopted in the 1980s and 1990s.
Post revises Sanders’ resume
Attacks on lawmakers’ legislative records are pretty common. So are falsehoods about Sanders’ life and career.
Claims like those made in the Facebook post, that Sanders ""never held a job until age 53"" and that he ""lived off of welfare and four different women,"" have been circulating online since at least 2016 — the last time he ran for president. We rated a similar post False in March.
In that fact-check, we noted that, after graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964, Sanders held a variety of odd jobs, including carpenter and preschool teacher. Those were likely not full time, but working part-time jobs is not the same as being unemployed.
RELATED STORY: Fact-checking the Democratic presidential debate in Houston
We also found no evidence to support the claim that Sanders lived off welfare, which generally consists of several government programs designed to help low-income individuals, before being elected. 
A spokesperson for his campaign previously told us that the assertion was made-up. There have been media reports suggesting Sanders collected unemployment benefits in 1974, the second time he ran for U.S. Senate representing Vermont. He won only 4.1% of the vote that year, partially because he campaigned as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which advocates for democratic socialism. 
Sanders also made unsuccessful bids for governor of Vermont in 1972, 1976 and 1986. He served as mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989 before joining the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991. In 2006, he was elected to the Senate.
The source of the claim that Sanders lived off ""four different women"" is unclear. The senator has been married twice, but there’s no evidence to suggest they were the primary breadwinners.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed, ""In Congress, Elizabeth Warren introduced 110 bills. 2 passed. Cory Booker introduced 120 bills. 0 passed. Kamala Harris introduced 54 bills. 0 passed. Bernie Sanders never held a job until age 53. He lived off of welfare and four different women.""
The post attacks the legislative effectiveness of Senate Democrats. The original tweet is also inaccurate; at the time, all the senators mentioned had sponsored bills that passed the Senate. Two of Booker’s bills had even been signed by the president. As for Sanders, the post fabricates several parts of the senator’s biography.
The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False."
5,"""For the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women.""","on Friday, September 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/27/donald-trump/fact-checking-trump-hiring-minorities-women/,Half-True,Donald Trump,"-checking Trump on hiring of minorities, women","President Donald Trump during a forum with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said economic indicators painted a good picture for minority workers.
Trump promoted low unemployment numbers for minorities and said that ""for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women.""
Is Trump right that minorities and women for the first time account for most new hires of prime working age? 
Trump’s re-election campaign told PolitiFact that Trump relied on reporting by the Washington Post. However, Trump imprecisely recounted the Post’s analysis. The Post found that for the first time, most new hires of prime working age are people of color, and that within that segment, women are predominantly driving the trend. An economist told us that the president’s statement and the wording in the Post article are significantly different.
Washington Post analysis
A Sept. 9 Washington Post article said that a ""surge of minority women getting jobs has helped push the U.S. workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color."" The Post noted that ""minority hires overtook white hires"" in 2018 and that women were ""predominantly driving this trend."" 
The newspaper said its findings were based on data the Department of Labor began collecting in the 1970s.
The Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics told PolitiFact that it did not have data that identified ""new hires"" by age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, or sex.
But it is theoretically possible, as the Post did, to analyze different sets of data to construct something that could be defined as a ""new hire,"" the bureau said.
The Post’s analysis used detailed microdata from the Current Population Survey and other related statistics, said economists who guided the Post on how to analyze the labor market data. Specifically, the Post downloaded an extract from IPUMS (a project of the University of Minnesota) that ""allows researchers to create more detailed analysis than the number released every month in the well-known jobs report,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab who focuses on the U.S. labor market and whom the Post consulted about its data analysis.
Overall, the Post found that based on data collected since the 1970s, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) were people of color, and women within that segment were pushing the trend. 
That’s not the same as saying that minorities and women represent most of the new hires, as Trump said.
""The president's paraphrase of the findings is incorrect as it includes non-Hispanic white women,"" Bunker said.
Ernie Tedeschi, a managing director and policy economist at Evercore ISI, also told us that the majority of prime-age job finders over the last 24 months have been people of color. Tedeschi uses the term ""job finders"" to refer to people who transition from nonemployment one month to having a job the next month.
What’s influencing the trend?
""A lot of what’s going on here is population growth: prime-age America is much less white than it used to be,"" Tedeschi said. ""As a result, prime-age Americans of color, in particular women, are a growing share of the prime-age overall and nonemployed populations.""
College attainment is also rising for everyone and especially for Americans of color, and that increases their chances of getting jobs, said Tedeschi, who offered the Post guidance on how to analyze the labor market data.
The Post flagged additional factors driving the trend: Latino women being encouraged to work outside the home, a need for two incomes to pay the bills, and men being deported and women needing to enter the workforce to support their families.
""This trend will likely continue if the labor market remains strong,"" Bunker said. ""But an economic downturn might reverse the trend, and we might not see people of color make up most of new prime-age hires again until the labor market has strengthened for quite some time.""
Our ruling
Trump said, ""For the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women.""
Trump’s re-election campaign said Trump’s claim is based on an analysis by the Washington Post. But Trump’s phrasing is off.
The Post reported that according to data collected by the government since the 1970s, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) were minorities, and minority women were predominantly driving the trend. That isn’t the same as saying minorities and women (of all races and ethnicities) account for most of the new hires of prime working age.
Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True."
5,Says a photo of a woman with multiple bruises on her face is Democrat Keith Ellison’s girlfriend and he is responsible for her injuries.,"on Friday, September 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/27/viral-image/no-badly-bruised-woman-photo-was-not-former-us-rep/,False,Viral image,"No, that badly bruised woman in photo was not former U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison’s girlfriend | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","A Facebook post shows a disturbing image of a badly bruised woman and claims her injuries were sustained by her boyfriend, former Democratic congressman Keith Ellison, who now serves as Minnesota’s attorney general. 
The post displays a split image of Ellison on the left and, on the right, a photo of a woman with a swollen cheek and a bruised eye.
Text above and below the image says:
""Keith Ellison the candidate for Minnesota attorney general and deputy chair of the democratic national committee did this to his girlfriend. But the Democrats don’t want to talk about this."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The information in the post is old. Ellison won the race for Minnesota’s attorney general in November 2018, after which he stepped down as deputy chair of the DNC. 
But was the woman in the photo Ellison’s girlfriend? And is he responsible for the injuries?
No, and no. The image is miscaptioned and has appeared online on various websites for several years.
After running a reverse-image search we found the photo of the injured woman has been shared online since at least 2013 on Russian websites, with little description or detail. The photo started including Ellison’s name right around the time his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, accused him of abuse in 2018.
In August of that year, Monahan’s son wrote a lengthy Facebook post that claimed Ellison abused his mother. Monahan confirmed her son’s account.
In a statement, Ellison acknowledged the two were in a relationship that ended in 2016, but denied abusing her or that such a video existed. 
It was in that context that this bruised photo of a woman began to circulate online, with people claiming it was Monahan. But Monahan herself tweeted a response saying that it was not her, and asked users not to share it ""with any connection to me or my story. Please honor this ladies wounds, pain and trauma.""

Monahan released medical notes from her doctor that said she reported she was in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship, and that she identified the partner as Ellison. But the doctor also noted that she did not have ""any physical injuries that required a physical examination."""
5,"The Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household.""","on Friday, September 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/sep/27/republican-party-florida/gop-talking-point-green-new-deal-will-cost-every-h/,False,Republican Party of Florida,"This GOP talking point that the Green New Deal will cost every household $600,000 is False | PolitiFact Florid","Critics of the Green New Deal have circulated numerous false claims about the resolution — saying it would do everything from ban farting cows to eliminate air travel.
Now the Republican Party of Florida is repeating a familiar talking point that the Green New Deal would create a scary pricetag.
""Democrats are proposing a radical $93 trillion Green New Deal which has been condemned by unions as a job killer and would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household,"" the Florida GOP tweeted Sept. 20.
We previously fact-checked a claim that included the $93 trillion figure and rated it False. (President Donald Trump rounds up the claim to $100 trillion.) Here we will explain why the $600,000 figure is misleading, too.
We found there is no government analysis of the cost of the Green New Deal per household. This is in part because the Green New Deal expresses goals; it doesn’t lay out specific policies. The $600,000 figure is based on adding up estimates in a report from a right-of-center group that cautioned it was an ""initial foray."" But the GOP talking point exaggerates and oversimplifies the analysis so much that the $600,000 figure can’t be considered accurate.
The basics about the Green New Deal
The Green New Deal is a House resolution that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, introduced in February. 
Resolutions are not actual, detailed legislation in themselves. In this case, the Green New Deal resolution in the House — and its companion measure that was introduced in the Senate — address broad principles to curb climate change and protect the environment. The resolutions extend into other domestic policy areas, as well, including jobs and health care. 
But the proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures, and it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The House resolution was forwarded to several committees and subcommittees for further review. The Republican-led Senate, meanwhile, voted down the measure in March after it was introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and co-sponsored by many Senate Democrats running for president.
The source of the $600,000 figure
The Florida GOP did not respond to our questions about the source of their evidence, but conservative news outlets have cited the $600,000 figure from a February report by the American Action Forum, a right-of-center think tank. The American Action Forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative advocacy organization.
The American Action Forum acknowledged the difficulty in coming up with a number for the cost, saying that ""the breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess"" and that many of the proposed policies are redundant, ""which also complicates a precise analysis.""
The report doesn’t mention the $600,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show the estimated per-household cost for different parts of the Green New Deal, some of which were expressed in ranges.
The Florida GOP’s tweet said that the Green New Deal  ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household"" -- which could suggest a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that every household will pay that cost in new taxes. And the costs identified in the analysis are spread over about a decade, from 2020 to 2029.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told PolitiFact that he stands by the analysis.
""We never actually added it up,"" he said. ""We tried to get the order of magnitude, what are we looking at here? That was the intent of that first piece.""
If we add up the high-end range in each category, that adds up to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we added up the low-end range in each category, it adds up to $369,010. 
To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would lead to enough high-speed rail transit available that air travel becomes unnecessary. The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes. (A much-panned FAQ document written by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff said ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."" But a staff-written FAQ carries zero weight legislatively.)
The American Action Forum analysis also factored in costs for Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. However, the text of the Senate resolution itself doesn’t include a statement on Medicare for All -- instead, it more broadly calls for ""high-quality health care."" (At least some of the resolution co-sponsors do support separate legislation Medicare for All however.)
Holtz-Eakin said he had hoped more specifics would emerge from proponents allowing a more specific cost analysis, but that hasn’t happened, he said.
Our ruling
The Florida GOP tweeted that the Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household.""
The Green New Deal is a set of goals; it does not impose specific taxes. Instead, the $600,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say that every household would pay an extra $600,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated what costs might be under a range of scenarios over a period of 10 years. 
It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, such costs can’t be determined.
We rate this statement False."
5,"Says Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a school computer program, ""saying it would be better spent in urban districts like Madison and Milwaukee.""","on Friday, September 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/27/rob-swearingen/state-rep-exaggerates-claim-gov-tony-evers-veto-sc/,False,Rob Swearingen,State rep exaggerates claim on Gov. Tony Evers veto of school technology program | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Partisan sniping over school spending in Wisconsin remains alive and well — even though the budget and capstone vetoes have been finalized for months.
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, the former state schools superintendent, made education funding for K-12 education a centerpiece of his gubernatorial campaign and steered an extra $65 million toward schools with some of his 78 vetoes.
But a recent Republican weekly radio address — aired by broadcasters around the state — leveled criticism for money Evers pulled away from one school program.
State Rep. Rob Swearingen, R-Rhinelander, took aim at Evers for a veto that squelched a personal electronic computing devices program, which had funded equipment such as  Chromebooks and tablets. The program distributed $7.9 million to 353 districts in the 2018-19 school year, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
""As of July, students in 352 districts across the state, plus three charter schools, benefitted from the program,"" Swearingen said in the Sept. 5, 2019, address. ""In vetoing this worthy program, Governor Evers took money off the table for kids across the state, saying it would be better spent in urban districts like Madison and Milwaukee.""
Aside from his district count being off by one, Swearingen — representing a largely rural area — is making the case that Evers diverted money from around the state to funnel it to the state’s largest districts. 
Let’s see if he’s right.
Claim hinges on veto message
As backup, Swearingen spokesman Joe Mesec pointed us to Evers’ veto message. The 65-page document included a brief description of Evers’ action on the computing device program.
Here’s what Evers said:
I object to providing funds to districts on a per-student basis using a membership calculation that does not match students enrolled in ninth grade. In addition, I believe that districts may choose to invest in technology through flexibility provided by the revenue limit increase and through the existing TEACH program. Further, these funds could more effectively be spent on programs that close achievement gaps.
Mesec then connected that to a 2017 Wisconsin State Journal story that noted Milwaukee and Madison have the widest achievement gaps between white and black students. He also listed other stories that referenced achievement gaps being an urban issue.
We’ll note that Evers’ veto lists several reasons in addition to the one Swearingen mentioned, including the way funding in this program was allocated and how other programs could address that need.
And Evers’ reference was not specific to racial achievement gaps, as Swearingen assumes in connecting this claim to Milwaukee and Madison. There are several other types of achievement gaps, with some overlap between them.
For example, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum released a report in March that detailed the low scores in math and reading posted in Wisconsin by English learners, students with limited English proficiency. They found the three districts with the highest percentage of English learners (more than 30% of the student body) were Arcadia, Abbotsford and Independence — all small, rural districts.
And a DPI program launched in 2015-16 aims at closing the income-based achievement gap.
Melissa Baldauff, an Evers spokeswoman, noted Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay are among the districts outside Milwaukee and Madison that face black-white achievement gaps. And she pointed out Evers didn’t move the money as Swearingen implied.
""Evers was saying broadly that funding to close achievement gaps is a more effective way to spend the dollars we do have,"" Baldauff said. ""He didn’t direct the money into other things.""
Our ruling
Swearingen claimed Evers vetoed a statewide computer devices program, ""saying it would be better spent in urban districts like Madison and Milwaukee."" 
The setup paints Evers as not prioritizing rural districts like those Swearingen represents.
But Swearingen offered no convincing evidence to support his claim.
Evers didn’t specifically shift the funds. And nothing in the veto message signals a rural-to-urban shift like the one Swearingen suggests — much less anything specific to Milwaukee and Madison.
Evers offered ideological objections based on how funding was allocated and how he felt education dollars could be best spent.
We rate Swearingen’s claim False."

Is that correct? We took a closer look. (The West Virginia Republican Party did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)
According to the Federal Reserve Economic Data website, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for women was 3.7% in July 2019, the latest data that was known at the time of the party’s tweet. In August 2019, the rate ticked down slightly, to 3.6%; the best showing came in April, with a rate of 3.4%.
Here’s a chart showing the full run of data for women’s unemployment.

The data shows one period with a lower unemployment rate for women: a 12-month period in 1952 and 1953. That’s about 66 years ago, which qualifies as ""nearly 70 years"" ago.
Brian Lego, an economist at West Virginia University, told PolitiFact that the Korean War in the early 1950s created some labor market distortions. Because the military draft pulled men out of the labor market, temporary jobs opened up for women.
It’s important to note that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.
In fact, the unemployment rate for women has been falling since 2010, when President Barack Obama was president. The unemployment rate for women fell from 8.7% in October 2010 to 4.7% when Obama left office in January 2017 -- a decline of four percentage points, or almost half.
Since Trump entered the White House, women’s unemployment has fallen by one point, or almost one-fifth.
Our Ruling
The West Virginia Republican Party said, ""Women’s unemployment has been lower under President Trump than it’s been in nearly 70 years.""
The actual number is 66 years, which qualifies as ""nearly 70."" However, it’s important to note that presidents don’t deserve full credit or blame for such statistical changes on their watch.

Everything we see is a perspective, not a truth."" 
We have a few opinions of our own about this one. And others had questions — this post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which also owns Instagram.) 
First, there’s the Instagram account. It has 361,000 followers and the bio suggests that the account belongs to the actor Jim Carrey — it has an illustration of his face and says, ""Alrighty then.""  
But the account isn’t verified with a blue checkmark, unlike the real @JimCarrey Twitter account. That account’s bio says: ""The ONLY official social media account for Actor Jim Carrey!""and has 18.5 million followers. 
Second, the illustration of the man in the Instagram post doesn’t look like Marcus Aurelius. He looks like Caracalla, another Roman Emperor who was given the name Septimius Bassianus at birth and renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. 
But Caracalla a.k.a. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus is not the same Marcus Aurelius who wrote philosophical musings in ""Meditations"" and to whom this quote is often attributed.
We didn’t find the quote searching an online version of the book and we couldn’t find a credible citation showing that Marcus Aurelius said it.
Dirk Baltzly, a philosophy and gender studies professor at the University of Tasmania in Australia, told us it’s ""just vaguely possible"" that the quote in the Instagram post ""is a highly creative"" translation or paraphrase from a passage in Meditations. One edition translates the original Greek this way: 
""But among the principles readiest to thine hand, upon which thou shalt pore, let there be these two. One, that objective things do not lay hold of the soul, but stand quiescent without; while disturbances are but the outcome of that opinion which is within us. A second, that all this visible world changes in a moment, and will be no more; and continually bethink thee to the changes of how many things thou hast already been a witness. ‘The Universe—mutation: Life—opinion.’ ""
But, Baltzly said, this is an old-fashioned and poor translation. Marcus Aurelius’s view wasn’t that there are no facts. Rather, he believed there are facts but that properly understood, none of the facts of the external world should disturb us. 
""What disturbs us is the (allegedly false) opinion that, for instance, death is a bad thing or that losing your money really harms you,"" Baltzly told us in an email. ""In truth, the only thing that should disturb you is the realization of your own moral feelings and — unlike all the crap in the world — that’s something you yourself can fix.""
Because the universe is constantly changing and each person plays a relatively small part in the world and then dies, Baltzly said, ""everyone has a limited perspective on it."" But that doesn’t mean that people don’t know anything or that there are no objective facts and only perspectives.
""The emperor was a stoic — not a skeptic,"" Baltzly said. ""So I’d call BS on that quote.""

Therefore, according to the post, you should stay in bed for a minute and a half when you wake up, sit in bed for another half minute, and then lower your legs and sit on the edge of the bed for another half minute. 
""After three and a half minutes, your brain will no longer be anemic and your heart will not weaken, which will reduce the risk of falling and sudden death,"" the post says, encouraging people to share this guidance with family and friends.

We turned to Dr. Sina Gharib, an associate professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, for help parsing these online directions. He told us he knows of no evidence to corroborate the Facebook post. 
""The only caveat is that, especially in elderly (and usually in the setting of using blood pressure medication, so dehydration), sudden rise from supine to upright positions may cause a drop in blood pressure,"" he said in an email. ""Lower blood pressure to the brain can cause dizziness or even a blackout (not death).""
This is known as ""orthostatic hypotension,"" he added, and in such cases people should be careful about how they get out of bed. ""Initially sitting then rising may be important,"" he said.
There’s also a condition called micturition syncope, said Dr. Hashim Hashim, a urological surgeon and professor at Bristol Urological Institute. If someone gets out of bed quickly to use the bathroom, their blood pressure could drop causing something called ""postural hypotension,"" he explained. Someone could faint due to that sudden drop in blood pressure and, ""obviously, if they faint and fall and hit their head on something hard they could sustain a head injury and die,"" he said. But he doesn’t know of a direct link between the condition and death absent a secondary injury.
And, of course, deaths during the night do happen ⁠— and for many reasons, Gharib said, including due to drug overdoses. One of the most common causes is known as ""sudden cardiac death."" This is often due to an underlying coronary heart disease that may have been unrecognized, Gharib said. There’s also some evidence that untreated sleep apnea may increase the risk of sudden death, possibly as a trigger for an abnormal heart rhythm. 
But that’s unrelated to anything described in this Facebook post.

6,"""A lot of people are talking about"" the removal of a ""very fair prosecutor"" in Ukraine.","on Thursday, September 26th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trumps-boasts-about-former-ukrainian-prosec/,False,Donald Trump,Donald Trump’s boasts about former Ukrainian prosecutor’s fairness ring false,"President Donald Trump in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart repeatedly suggested that an ousted Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed a reputation for fairness when then-vice president Joe Biden in 2015 stepped in to press for the prosecutor’s removal. 
A White House summary of a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows Trump describing Ukraine’s former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin as a ""very good"" and ""very fair prosecutor.""
""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved,"" Trump said, according to the readout, later adding, ""I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor.""
A few moments later, Trump added, ""The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … .""
We decided to fact-check whether the Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed the positive reputation Trump claimed. The notion that Shokin was widely seen as a ""very good"" and ""very fair prosecutor"" is inconsistent with our findings.
Shokin’s reputation
Trump’s claim requires some additional context. In his phone call with Zelenksy, Trump never referred to Shokin by name. But the context of the call, including his remarks about Biden, seems to make clear that Shokin is who Trump had in mind. In fact, by the time he resigned, he was widely considered corrupt and ineffective.
The White House did not respond to our request for comment and for information that would support this positive view of Shokin’s tenure. We also independently looked for affirmative reviews of Shokin’s work and weren’t able to find anything substantive or specific. 
Trump and Zelensky discussed the possibility of reviving a dormant Ukrainian government investigation into a Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served as a board member on while his father was vice president. (See our related fact-check.)
Trump’s reference to the Ukrainian prosecutor being ""shut down"" is an apparent reference to Shokin’s ouster in 2016, which then-Vice President Joe Biden helped orchestrate. 
Biden had assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine amid a popular revolution that in early 2014 led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired. According to Biden, it worked. 
During an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, the former vice president made the following remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:
""I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t. ...
""They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""
(We’ll note that this transcript shows that Trump mischaracterized Biden’s remarks when he told Zelensky in their call that ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution"" into the company his son was involved in. Biden bragged about getting rid of an ineffective prosecutor, not stopping an investigation.)
Trump’s boasts about Shokin — that he was widely seen as a ""very good"" and ""very fair prosecutor"" —  clash with the view of many Western leaders and institutions. Largely, they were united in seeking Shokin’s removal. 
When Shokin was sacked on March 26, 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Here’s how the New York Times described it:
MOSCOW — Bowing to pressure from international donors, the Ukrainian Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove a prosecutor general who had clung to power for months despite visible signs of corruption. 
In fairness, the Times’ also said experts on Ukrainian politics said Shokin ""had played an important role in balancing competing political interests, helping maintain stability during a treacherous era in the divided country’s history.""
But strong Western opposition to Shokin was well established prior to his ouster.
For instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that ""it’s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue"" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate.
Steven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that ""virtually everyone"" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine ""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.""
This view is reflected in a Sept. 2015 speech that then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, delivered in Odessa, Ukraine (emphasis ours):
""There is one glaring problem that threatens all of the good work that regional leaders here in Odessa, in Kharkiv, in Lviv, and elsewhere are doing to improve the business climate and build a new model of government that serves the people,"" Pyatt said, later adding, ""That obstacle is the failure of the institution of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to successfully fight internal corruption. Rather than supporting Ukraine’s reforms and working to root out corruption, corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General’s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform."" 
Anders Åslund, a resident senior fellow at Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread.
""Shokin was perceived as utterly corrupt and very close to President Poroshenko,"" Åslund said. ""His corruption was exposed by his two young and obviously honest deputies"" who were forced out.
The case that attracted the most negative attention to Shokin involved the arrest of a Kyiv city prosecutor, Åslund said. During the arrest, authorities seized several million dollars worth of diamonds at the prosecutor’s home. Not only did Shokin release the prosecutor, but he also returned his diamonds.
""The steady complaint was that Shokin blocked all attempts to have the Yanukovych crooks arrested or any of the billions they had stolen recovered,"" Åslund said. ""Shokin successfully blocked any asset recovery, and he did so in a very blatant fashion.""
Domestically, Shokin’s corruption was the cause célèbre of repeated street protests organized by anti-corruption activists.
As news of Trump’s interaction with Zelenksy made headlines in recent weeks, Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, began to tweet images and videos of 2015 protests against Shokin. 
One photograph she posted, from July 2015, showed a protest before the prosecutor general's office to demand Shokin resign ""because of his corruption, attacks on reformers and failure to investigate corruption of Yanukivych associates."" (The photograph is similar to photographs in the Associated Press database of the same event on the same date.) 
This is July 24, 2015. Jointly with other NGOs we are running protest in front of prosecutors general office demanding Shokin resignation - because of his corruption, attacks on reformers and failure to investigate corruption of Yanukivych associates https://t.co/kv46MavjH3 pic.twitter.com/kr8oELbPpR— Daria Kaleniuk (@dkaleniuk) September 23, 2019 
When Shokin was ultimately sacked in early 2016, his reputation was in tatters, according to the Kyiv Post, Ukraine’s oldest English language newspaper.
""By the end of his term he was likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine,"" the Kyiv Post wrote, ""having earned a bad reputation for inaction and obstructing top cases.""
Our ruling
Trump said ""a lot of people are talking about"" the removal of a ""very fair prosecutor"" in Ukraine. 
The former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, whom Trump appeared to be referencing, did not enjoy the sterling reputation Trump claimed. Far from it. Many Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin’s removal. Domestically, he was ""likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine"" over his reputation for corruption, the subject of popular street protests.  
We rate this claim False.

6,Says a photo shows a dog who has slept by his master’s grave every night for seven years.,"on Thursday, September 26th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/26/viral-image/dog-named-capitan-known-sleeping-his-owners-grave-/,False,Viral image,A dog named Capitán is known for sleeping by his owner’s grave — but this photo is not of him | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Among all the misinformation posted online, there’s one image regularly shared on Facebook that’s a little kinder than the rest. Cuddlier, even. And maybe you’ve seen it: a dog that looks like it could be a yellow lab curled on top of a grave. 
""It has been 7 years,"" begins a June 19 post of the image. ""The cemetery does not close the gates until he arrives every night. His name is Captain. He sleeps by his master’s grave every night. Semper Fi!""
The post has an American flag emoji and the words, ""I hope I get just one share."" 
It got more than 25,000 times that, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
That’s because not everything is as it seems in the post. There was a dog named Capitán who slept at his owner’s graveside, according to Argentinian newspaper La Voz del Interior, but it wasn’t the dog pictured.
In 2012, the paper reported that in Villa Carlos Paz, a mutt called Capitán, described as having some German Shepherd in him, disappeared after his owner, Miguel Guzmán, died in March 2006. They thought the dog had died until Guzmán’s widow and son went to the cemetery about 15 blocks away and found Capitán there. The dog wouldn’t follow them and instead stayed in the cemetery, according to La Voz. The following Sunday, the dog walked home with them ""but then returned to the cemetery,"" La Voz quotes Guzmán’s widow as saying. 
Capitán would sometimes visit the house but ""he returns to the cemetery,"" La Voz quotes Guzmán’s son as saying. 
The newspaper reported that it confirmed the story with Héctor Baccega, the director of the Municipal Cemetery of Villa Carlos Paz. Cemetery employees saw Capitán enter the cemetery for the first time in January 2007. A video with the news story shows Capitán to be black with tan markings.
""Every day, at six in the afternoon, he goes and lies down in front of that grave,"" Baccega is quoted as saying. ""Capitán walked the cemetery with me every day. But when that time comes he goes to the bottom, where his master’s grave is.""
In February 2018, more than a decade after Miguel Guzmán’s death, Capitán also died, according to La Paz. He had lived in the cemetery among other stray dogs but he spent nights at his master’s grave, the paper says.
In August, Carlos Paz debuted a monument to the dog in the cemetery. 
We don’t know the origins of the image featured in the Facebook post, but it’s appeared on websites like Reddit, where it was shared in 2017 under the title: ""Must have been a good human. Dogs are something else."" After it was posted on imgur.com a few days later, one user commented:  ""FYI, this is from a Facebook post that clarified the dog moved from spot to spot, not keeping any specific headstone company.""
This Facebook post appears to blend fact with fiction. A dog named Capitán — Spanish for captain — reportedly slept by his deceased owner’s grave every night. But he was a black German Shepherd mix — not at all similar to the yellow lab depicted in the photo — and he apparently spent most of his time at the cemetery, not, not arriving at its cemetery gates every night. And this all happened in Argentina, not the United States. So while the U.S. Marine Corps motto of Semper Fi, or ""always faithful,"" might apply, the American flag emoji does not.
We rate this Facebook post False."

It’s been shared more than 93,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Searching for the quote online we found 10 results, but they were from meme websites like me.me or awwmemes.com, 
In 2006, Hussein testified in his defense against charges of crimes against humanity, and he called on Iraqis to join together to defeat the U.S.-led occupation in Iraq, according to C-SPAN. But in reviewing that testimony, we didn’t read anything like the quote that appears on Facebook. 
Searching for the quote in the news archive Nexis we found no results. Nor did we find it searching Google Books, or reviewing online versions of ""Saddam’s War of Words"" and ""The Saddam Tapes,"" which contains annotated transcripts of audio recordings of meetings between Hussein and his allies. 
We reached out to the author of ""The Saddam Tapes"" and others who have studied Iraq and Hussein, but they were all unfamiliar with the quote. 
Kevin Woods, the book’s author, said ""the idea behind the quote is implicit in many of the discussions between Saddam and Tariq Aziz,"" Hussein’s top aide, but that the quote wasn’t something he recognized. 
Samuel Helfont, assistant professor of strategy and policy, U.S. Naval War College, told us in an email that ""it sounds like something he would say, and that was certainly his strategy in the 1990s/early 2000s."" 
Amatzia Baram, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Haifa in Israel, said the only case where he sees Hussein implying an idea like the statement in the Facebook post stems from his 1990 meeting with April Glaspie, then the U.S. ambassador to Iraq. It was a week before Hussein invaded Kuwait, Baram said, and he told Glaspie that since the Vietnam War, the United States can’t afford casualties but Hussein can. (""Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000 dead in one battle,"" he told Glaspie, according to Newsweek.)
""The connotation was that American war policies can be influenced through casualties,"" Baram said. 
If evidence emerges that Hussein made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, we’ll reconsider our ruling. But lacking any proof that this attribution is accurate, we rate the post False."
6,Says police are warning shoppers to use wipes to clean their carts over deadly risk of fentanyl residue.,"on Thursday, September 26th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/26/facebook-posts/no-police-arent-warning-shoppers-use-wipes-carts-o/,False,Facebook posts,"No, police aren’t warning shoppers to use wipes on carts over fentanyl overdose risk | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","A viral Facebook post claims police are warning shoppers to use wipes on shopping carts to prevent overdosing on fentanyl residue: 
""You know when you go to Wal-Mart and the grocery store and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? How many of you don’t use them? Well, I do and I always thought of the germs only. Was told that the police also suggests (sic) you do it because of all the problems with drugs, if someone has Fentanyl still on their hands and they touch that cart they transfer it to the cart, then you get it on you, one drop can cause death. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you have to do is rub your nose or touch your child’s mouth. Copy and post. I did! This is a scary truth.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This claim is inaccurate. First, police are not warning about shopping cart handles as a means of fentanyl overdose. And second, a close look into the medical research shows that overdose through skin contact is highly unlikely.
The idea that a small amount of fentanyl residue can cause an overdose by skin contact alone took off following a May 2017 incident in which an Ohio police officer said he came into contact with the residue while searching a car and later began to overdose after he brushed some off his shirt. Reports at the time said it took multiple doses of Narcan, an emergency ""opioid antagonist"" used to counter the effects of overdose, to revive him.
Warnings about the dangers of the drug residue went viral by November 2017 after someone posted a variation of this notice on the Facebook page of the Leachville Police Department in Arkansas. The department deleted the post shortly after and, according to contemporaneous reports, posted an update apologizing for the misinformation: 
""The post about the fentanyl was sent (to) me from another officer at another department. I simply shared it. I'm (sic) should have checked into it further before I posted it. Sorry for the confusion.""
First, there are different forms of fentanyl. One can be legally prescribed as a skin patch that regulates the release of the drug through the skin.
But, in this case, the viral post is referring to the powder form of street fentanyl, which can be 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and can cause death in small doses.  
There is no question that there is a legitimate risk of fentanyl overdose when it is ingested or injected intravenously, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and such overdoses are on the rise. But while skin contact can be an exposure route, experts from the CDC say it isn’t likely to lead to an overdose unless there is a large amount of highly concentrated powder:
""Responders are most likely to encounter illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues in powder, tablet, and liquid form. Potential exposure routes of greatest concern include inhalation, mucous membrane contact, ingestion, and percutaneous exposure (e.g., needlestick). Any of these exposure routes can potentially result in a variety of symptoms that can include the rapid onset of life-threatening respiratory depression. Skin contact is also a potential exposure route, but is not likely to lead to overdose unless large volumes of highly concentrated powder are encountered over an extended period of time. Brief skin contact with fentanyl or its analogues is not expected to lead to toxic effects if any visible contamination is promptly removed.""
When it comes to whether an overdose is possible after someone touches the residue to their ""nose or mouth"" as the post warns, PolitiFact reached out to the American Chemical Society, a nonprofit organization that supports scientific inquiry in the field of chemistry.
""Yes, small amounts of fentanyl can be picked up from surfaces and absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes (e.g. nasal passages),"" Richard Sachleben, a retired chemist, wrote in an email. ""However, it would take a pretty substantial level of surface contamination for a person to receive a fatal dose of fentanyl this way. The human lethal dose is not well established, but probably on the order of milligrams for adults, and lower for children and infants. To get a milligram dose of fentanyl from a shopping cart, for instance, would probably require tens to hundreds of milligrams to be present on the surface, which is pretty unlikely.""
Medical experts who looked into the May 2017 account of the Ohio police officer who was treated following his exposure to fentanyl took issue with the notion that it was the casual physical contact that caused his reaction. They said that while it was possible the officer accidentally ingested the powder, overdosing by only touching a small amount was implausible. 
Jeremy Samuel Faust, an emergency physician at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, wrote a piece in Slate questioning the incident:
""Neither fentanyl nor even its uber-potent cousin carfentanil (two of the most powerful opioids known to humanity) can cause clinically significant effects, let alone near-death experiences, from mere skin exposure … Each of the medical and toxicology professionals I asked agreed that it’s implausible that one could overdose from brushing powder off a shirt.""
Faust also cites Ed Boyer in the article, a medical toxicologist, who said that fentanyl applied dry to the skin ""will not be absorbed."" 
Around the same time, the American College of Medical Toxicology issued a new position statement on fentanyl, saying that ""incidental dermal absorption is unlikely to cause opioid toxicity.""
Our ruling
A viral Facebook post says police are warning shoppers to use wipes to clean their cart handles to mitigate the risk of overdosing on fentanyl residue.
The risk of overdosing from fentanyl residue via the skin is unlikely, medical experts say. As well, the rumor went viral after being mistakenly shared by a police department, which has since apologized and deleted the post. 
This claim is not accurate. We rate it False."
6,"""80% of the world’s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed.""","on Wednesday, September 25th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/25/donald-trump/donald-trumps-flawed-stat-threats-religious-freedo/,Half-True,Donald Trump,Donald Trump's flawed stat on threats to religious freedom,"In his United Nations General Assembly speech, President Donald Trump focused on trade, Iran and North Korea. But he also touched on protecting gay rights, gun ownership and freedom of religion. Trump put forth the United States as a pillar of religious toleration, speaking of the ""ironclad American commitment"" to protecting religious freedom.
""Hard to believe, but 80% of the world’s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed,"" Trump said Sept 24. ""We want and support religious liberty for all.""
There’s some substance to Trump’s statistic, but it relies on the broadest definition of threats to religion.
How broad?
Well, in the underlying analysis, the United States itself was included as having having high rankings for one type of intolerance and ended in the same category as places such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.
Let’s unpack the number.
A business group crunches the numbers
The 80% figure shows up in a summary by the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation, an organization that promotes interfaith understanding and aims to show business leaders that ""religious freedom is good for business.""
The group looked at countries with high levels of governmental restrictions or social hostility rooted in religion and added up their populations. The country list came from the Pew Research Center, a reliable source of data.
""Pew Research Center data show that the number of people living in countries with high religious restrictions and hostilities has reached nearly six billion people, or 78.5% of the world's total population in 2017,"" the group’s president wrote in a presentation.
The math is correct, and supports Trump’s claim. But a closer look at the Pew study shows why a dose of caution applies.
The Pew study
The Pew Research Center’s most recent survey of religious restrictions looked at two types of problems: government actions, and actions by individuals or groups, which it called social hostility.
Jeremy Barker with the Religious Freedom Institute, a group that advocates for religious liberty, told us that when interpreting the findings, ""additional nuance is required.""
""While the total population of these countries is 6.3 billion, the restrictions may not evenly affect these people,"" Barker said.
Especially in the area of social hostility, all it takes is a handful of bad actors to put a country on a list of nations with relatively poor rankings.
In the government category, the report found that out of 198 countries, 52 had high or very high levels of governmental restrictions on religion.
In the very worst cases, government agents had arrested or detained people for reasons of their faith. The top offenders were China, Iran, Malaysia and Syria, and countries such as Russia and Indonesia ranked in the top 10. 
The Pew analysis had separate rankings for social hostility. Those included such acts as harassing women for the clothes they wear, religious violence by organized groups, and hate crimes by individuals. These can take place beyond the best efforts of governments to stop them.
It ranked 56 countries as showing high or very high social hostilities. India was at the very top, followed by Syria, Iraq and Egypt. With rising tensions in Europe tied to refugees, Denmark, Germany and Italy also appeared there. 
But so did the United States. It received higher rankings due to incidents such as the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where marchers chanted ""Jews will not replace us,"" and a fatal stabbing in Portland, Ore., when a man shouted anti-Muslim remarks to two women, one of whom was wearing a hijab.
While Trump exhorted other nations to match the commitment of the United States, his statistic included the United States and other nations with a tradition for protecting religious rights.
Combining the lists of governmental restrictions and social hostility, the report found that 83 individual nations ranked high in at least one or the other. Their combined population is close to 6 billion, of which the U.S. population is a part. That is the source of the 80% figure Trump cited.
Shaun Casey, director of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, said the 80% figure distorts the Pew report.
""The president is looking for a riveting number that says religious intolerance is on fire,"" Casey said. ""And you look at the data and it’s not true.""
Barker warned that a few countries have an outsized impact.
""Because a few large countries are included in this — India, China, Indonesia, etc. — the population share is very high compared to the raw number of countries.""
Anna Schiller, a Pew spokeswoman, said the center includes many variables but doesn’t rank them by severity or importance.
""We leave it up to our readers to form their own opinion based on the analysis we provide,"" Schiller said.
Our ruling
Trump said that 80% of the world’s people live in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or completely outlawed.
Ultimately, that is based on an independent group’s list of countries with what it deems high or very high levels of governmental or social intolerance of certain religions. But the underlying data sweeps up many laws and actions, some much more repressive than others. The United States shows up on one list, as do several other Western democracies.
There is no simple way to capture the experience of religious minorities. The 80% figure is dramatic, but the experts we reached agreed that it exaggerates the impact of government-sanctioned and societal religious intolerance on most people living in those countries.
We rate this Half True."

As of late September, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra had filed or joined 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration. His office has also filed friend of the court briefs in several additional cases against the administration. 
But is California really ""winning"" in court as Becerra and Gov. Gavin Newsom have confidently claimed? 
""We are winning. The vast majority of the lawsuits have been adjudicated in favor of California,"" Newsom said at a news conference on Sept. 16 at the state Capitol. 
Becerra has been equally self-assured: 
""Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win,"" Becerra claimed at a late August news conference where he announced one of California’s 14 lawsuits on immigration since the president took office. That suit seeks to block to block Trump administration rules that could indefinitely detain migrant children and their families. 
""If I were a baseball player, my batting average would be the envy of the MLB,"" he quipped in a Mercury-News article in May. ""We’re proving that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States.""
We set out to fact check Becerra’s claim: ""Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win."" 
Our research
CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, along with a Marquette University political science professor have separately tracked California’s lawsuits against the Trump administration. Records from both generally support Becerra’s claim that the state is winning in court, at least for the cases that have received rulings so far, though they also show the majority of lawsuits are still pending a final decision. 
The CalMatters database of 60 lawsuits showed the state had won 16 completed cases and lost two, while 38 are pending and another four were on hold, as of late September. 
California has scored some clear victories. In July, it prevailed in its effort to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the move and Trump abandoned his plan. The state also won a case against the administration’s attempt in 2017 to cut off certain federal funds for ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions. A district court ruled the move was unconstitutional. California again sued the administration last year after it withheld money for similar reasons. The state was also victorious in several cases where it sued to ensure federal energy and environmental regulations were implemented. 
In February, the state was dealt one of its few defeats following its lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from waiving environmental laws to speed up border wall construction of in California. A federal district judge and later an appeals panel ruled in favor of Trump. The state also lost a case it joined opposing Trump’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. The first version of the ban was struck down by a lower court, while a second partially went into effect but then expired. The Supreme Court upheld a third version in June 2018. 
Earlier in Becerra’s August news conference, the AG offered a more nuanced and complete version of his statement about California winning in court. 
""Unfortunately, close to 60 times now this administration has taken actions which would harm the people of the state of California. And in most of the cases that we’ve filed, we have been victorious so far in the rulings that we’ve secured,"" Becerra told reporters.
A spokesperson for Becerra provided a list of the state’s cases against the Trump administration, along with information about the status of each, though not an explicit win/loss breakdown. 
""Some have concluded, but many are ongoing,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email.
‘California has had great success in court’
Paul Nolette, the Marquette political science professor, is tracking all multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration. His database includes the majority of cases filed by California against the administration, though not the 13 solo cases the state has filed against it.
As of mid-September, Nolette said California had been successful on nearly 90 percent of the multi-state lawsuits that had received at least an initial judgment, though he cautioned that a majority of the cases are still awaiting a final ruling. 
""California has had great success in court against the Trump administration, looking at both those completed cases as well as looking at those other cases that are still working their way up through the system,"" Nolette said. 
Here’s how the state has fared, based on Nolette’s data:
     • It is involved in 53 multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration
     • Of those, 21 cases have been completed while 32 are pending a final ruling
     • Of the 21 completed cases, it has won 16 and lost three. Two were voluntarily dismissed
Nolette said California’s record in the pending, multi-state cases is also good. 
""In cases where there’s been some sort of court judgment or ruling, California is 10 and 0. And some of those cases may still be on appeal. So, they could still lose,"" he said. ""But, I think if you combine both of those together (the pending and completed cases), that’s a lot of wins: Really 26 clear wins in these cases, against only three losses.""
California’s solo cases
Like the multi-state cases, California has had some early success in cases it has brought independently against the Trump administration. 
The attorney general’s office described 13 of its 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration as ""California-only suits."" Among those cited by the AG’s office, the state has two clear victories and one loss, according to a review by PolitiFact California. 
Nine of the cases are still pending, while one seeking conflict of interest documents from former EPA Director Scott Pruit was settled with the EPA producing the documents when Pruitt resigned last year without admitting guilt. 
UC Davis Law School Dean Kevin Johnson agreed California has a successful record in court so far.
""I think generally it’s a fair statement,"" he said of claims California is ‘winning.’ ""It’s not as easy as saying whether a team won a football game, though. Some of these cases are far from completion. For example, in the cases challenging the president’s executive order on punishing and defunding sanctuary jurisdictions, the case isn’t over.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment. 
Our ruling 
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra claimed at an August news conference, ""Every time we go to court,"" against the Trump administration, ""for the most part, we win."" 
A Marquette political science professor and CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, are separately tracking California’s lawsuits. Their records each show the state has won the vast majority of cases that have received at least an initial or completed ruling. 
But that doesn’t mean California has won ""every time we go to court,"" as Becerra put it, even acknowledging his qualifier ""for the most part.""
Most cases are still working their way through the courts and have yet to receive final judgments, some of which could go against California. That important caveat is not reflected in Becerra’s claim.  
Becerra does, however, offer a more complete statement earlier in the press conference, saying ""in most of the cases that we’ve filed, we have been victorious so far in the rulings that we’ve secured."" 
Given this context and California’s early success in court, Becerra’s claim is generally accurate. 
We rate his claim Mostly True. 

MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

6,"""Europe and other nations (need to) contribute to Ukraine. Because they’re not doing it. Just the United States. We’re putting up the bulk of the money.""","on Wednesday, September 25th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-european-nations-have-not-put-mo/,Mostly False,Donald Trump,Donald Trump said European nations have not put money into Ukraine. They have put in,"In a scrum with reporters outside the U.N. General Assembly hall, President Donald Trump was asked why he held up at least $250 million in military aid to Ukraine shortly before his July phone call with Ukraine’s president that has now triggered a House impeachment inquiry.
""My complaint has always been — and I’d withhold again, and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,"" Trump said Sept. 24. ""Because they’re not doing it. Just the United States. We’re putting up the bulk of the money. And I’m asking, why is that.""
Have Europe and other countries failed to contribute to Ukraine?
No. While the United States has taken the lead on military aid, the Europeans, Japan and Canada have borne the brunt of economic and government restructuring aid to bolster Ukraine.
After 2014, the European Union and its financial assistance agencies put together $15 billion mainly in loans but also in direct grants to Ukraine. Spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told PolitiFact in statement that described it as ""the largest support package in the history of the European Union.""
The package includes over 2 billion euros in grants, 49 million euros to monitor the truce in Eastern Ukraine, and a 3.5 billion euros loan package to develop and restore the county’s banking, agriculture and transportation systems. 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data shows that in 2016-2017, the European Union provided $425 million in development aid, with the United States spending $204 million, Germany $189 million and Japan $180 million.
""The Europeans did a whole lot more than the United States in terms of actual cash put into the Ukrainian budget,"" said Samuel Charap, a Ukraine analyst with RAND, a nonprofit research organization.
In contrast, the United States has done the heavy lifting on military aid.
In the past five years, Security Assistance Monitor, a nonprofit group, has tracked nearly $1.5 billion in defense aid to Ukraine.
Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and who served in the State Department in the George W. Bush years, described a de facto division of labor.
""The United States provides more military assistance, while Europe provides significant reform assistance,"" Pifer said. ""Both are necessary to bolster the country’s security.""
Individual European nations have done some work on the military side. 
Charap noted that the United Kingdom, Canada, Poland and other countries have sent military supplies and hundreds of trainers. Chiefly, though, he said, they have worked through NATO. In 2014, at the Welsh Summit, NATO member states established five new trust funds to help Ukraine’s military, with a budget of 10 million Euros. It later created a sixth fund.
Generally, Charap said, Europe has been cautious with direct military aid.
""The Europeans and particularly the Germans did not want to get involved in a proxy war,"" he said.
Charap also said it was easier for Europe to bolster Ukraine’s civilian institutions.
""The Europeans have more mechanisms for nonmilitary assistance through their extensive development work in Ukraine,"" Charap said.
Our ruling
Trump said the Europeans are not contributing to Ukraine and that only the United States is. In terms of military aid, the statement overlooks that NATO and individual European nations have spent over 10 million euros on equipment and training to help Ukraine’s military. However, the United States has provided the lion’s share of military aid.
Where the statement strays widely from the facts is on the nonmilitary side. There, the countries of Europe, individually and through multilateral European bodies, have done much more for Ukraine than the United States. The foreign policy experts we reached said both kinds of aid are necessary for Ukraine’s security.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

""Since ICE has not deported or detained one white illegal immigrant, which there are 600,000 of...can we admit this is about race?"" said the Aug. 15 post, shared at least 87,000 times as of Sept. 24.
A reader wanted to know if it was really true that no white immigrants have been deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
There’s no evidence for that. The Facebook post does not include any sources, and we did not find corresponding news stories or government data to support it. 
ICE does not track deportations based on race or ethnicity. The agency has statistics on where people are sent, but that alone doesn’t indicate someone’s race. 
Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were 9.75 million unauthorized people ages 18 and older. Of 9.75 million people, about 700,000 were white (not Hispanic), according to Pew.
PRI in July 2017 published a story about a man from Ireland deported from the United States for overstaying the length of his visa. The story identifies the deported man, John Cunningham, as a white immigrant. In addition to Cunningham, another man from Ireland who lived in the United States illegally and a representative from Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, ""all acknowledged that, as white men, they can fly under the radar of those who associate unauthorized immigrants with Mexico and Central America,"" the PRI story said.
A year before ICE arrested Cunningham, he told PRI: ""Most people think undocumented and they think people who come across the southern border. They’re not thinking about the Irish guy who lives right next to them. They don’t see that part of it, but we have to live with that every day.""
NPR in January 2018 also reported that a then-19-year-old man from Ireland, Dylan O’Riordan, had been detained by ICE and was scheduled to be deported. ""O'Riordan didn't necessarily think being white would save him from deportation orders. He thought staying out of trouble would keep him under the radar. He says other detainees are surprised he was arrested,"" the story said. ICE told NPR that O’Riordan overstayed the terms of his admission.
In fiscal year 2018, ICE deported close to 260,000 people. The top three countries where people were deported were Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Hispanics or Latinos (terms used to denote ethnicity) can be of any race, including white. 
Overall, in 2018 immigrants were deported to countries all over the world, including Norway, Russia, Ireland, Kenya, and China. (Here’s the full list of countries where immigrants were deported.)
The Trump administration says anyone in the country illegally is a priority for deportation.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said, ""ICE has not deported or detained one white illegal immigrant.""
The Facebook post does not include a source for its claim. ICE said it does not track the race of the people it removes from the country. Latin American countries were the top destinations where people were deported to in 2018. Hispanics or Latinos can be of any race, including white.
News reports have noted that white immigrants have been detained and deported by ICE during Trump’s presidency.

But one widely-shared photo claims those protesters aren’t practicing what they preach.
The photo, published on Facebook on Sept. 20, purports to show a field full of trash left behind by demonstrators.
""Yes, listen to the kids, they will guide our planet, I guess they haven’t learnt (sic) the basics yet,"" the caption reads.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s been shared more than 130,000 times, so we wanted to check it out.
Turns out the photo does not show the aftermath of any climate strike demonstrations — it was taken months before they even happened.
Using a reverse image search, we found the viral Facebook photo is at least five months old. It was originally posted online in April after an event celebrating 420, a holiday for marijuana enthusiasts, in London’s Hyde Park. 
But even in April, the image was taken out of context and miscaptioned in an effort to smear climate change protesters.
There's a lot of incorrect information doing the Twitter rounds this morning.

Around the same time as the 420 event in Hyde Park, climate change activists who were part of a movement called the Extinction Rebellion were protesting at various locations around central London. We found the miscaptioned trash photo in several replies to tweets from activists like Greta Thunberg, who gave a speech to the protesters April 21. The Swedish teenager is also credited with inspiring the Sept. 20 climate strike.

No. This faux tale is more than 12 years old and continues to resurface on social media even though it’s been debunked several times over the years. 
The rumor showed up on Facebook again on Sept. 20 on the page ""Adorable Deplorables for Trump"" and has gotten over 500 comments and more than 1,500 shares. 
The post shared an image of a young girl holding a shotgun with text below it that recounts the story:
""11-YEAR-OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS. Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things: 1. They were in Montana. 2. Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine...""

 
The post goes on to say that the girl grabbed a shotgun and killed both men before police were able to arrive and that one of the immigrants had already killed another man during an earlier home invasion. At the end it asks if you ever wonder why ""good stuff"" never makes the news.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
First, a reverse-image search revealed the girl in the photo is actually a 14-year-old from New Jersey who was featured in a piece by the New Yorker about kids who use recreational firearms.
And the story about the girl shooting intruders ""never made the news"" because it never actually happened. The account can only be found in other websites that repeat the same information, with no additional details. 
A search of the Nexis database surfaced a few stories where young people helped thwart home invasions by using firearms over the years, but none lined up with the post. 
We did find a 1988 story of an 11-year-old shooting and killing two burglars – but the child was a boy and the incident took place in Switzer, South Carolina. As well, the men were not named ""Ralphel Resindez"" and ""Enrico Garza,"" but were two ex-convicts named Danny Ray Abernathy and Broadus Petty. 
Some earlier versions of the rumor named the Montana town of Butte as being the location of the incident, but a 2007 story by the Montana Standard newspaper, which included an interview with the town’s sheriff, called the shooting ""nothing but an urban myth:""
""When asked about the authenticity of the events described in this story, Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh told The Montana Standard in an earlier interview that his office never investigated such an incident. ‘This never happened,’ Walsh said.
The story claims the girl shot and killed the two intruders while she was home alone. The story doesn’t provide a street address or attribute the information to any official sources.
Walsh brushed off the story of an urban myth. ‘It’s amazing how these things get around,’ he said.""
Phillip Morris, a columnist with The Plain Dealer, wrote a piece about the myth in 2013:
""There was no Ralphel Resindez, there was no Enrico Garza, and despite her elevation to heroine status with some gun rights groups, there was no little girl named Patricia who bravely defended her home with her father's shotgun. So why does this story still circulate?
""Probably, because it seems perfectly believable. For a nation that remains bitterly divided on the issues of immigration and gun control, this violent parable highlights the worst fears of what illegal immigration and stricter gun control could portend for the nation.""

6,"Kirk ""Cox joined special interests to deny teachers raises.""","on Tuesday, September 24th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/sep/24/sheila-bynum-coleman/contrary-bynum-coleman-cox-has-steadily-backed-tea/,Pants on Fire!,Sheila Bynum-Coleman,"Contrary to Bynum-Coleman's ad , Cox has steadily backed teacher raises | PolitiFact Virgin","Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman is trying to label Speaker Kirk Cox as opponent of teacher raises in a contentious race for the 66th District House seat.
Her first try ran into trouble. ""Cox joined with special interests to deny teachers a raise,"" she said in a TV ad that aired Sept. 4. But a small-print citation Bynum-Coleman used in the ad to back the claim was inaccurate. She cited Cox for a 2013 vote against the state budget with a teacher raise when, actually, he supported it. It was another delegate - John Cox - who opposed the budget.
Bynum-Coleman stopped the ad, and put up a new version the next day with the same claim and video, but amended sources. Cox’s campaign says the commercial is still inaccurate. So we fact-checked the second ad to see if Cox, a former teacher, ""joined with special interests to deny teachers a raise.""
Cox’s Voting Record
Cox joined the General Assembly in 1990. We tracked his voting record on teacher raises from 2005, which is the earliest year Bynum-Coleman cites in her contention that Cox has opposed pay hikes. 
Cox, a retired teacher, has been in a strong position to influence teacher pay. From, 2005-2017, he sat on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee of it that oversaw money going to public schools, and was on a small team of House negotiators who worked out final spending deals with the Senate. He became speaker in 2018.
Teacher raises are not singled out for a vote in the General Assembly. They appear as line items in thick state budgets hundreds of pages long. Since 2005, the legislature has approved seven budgets with lasting teacher pay raises, a Cox voted for each one. Here are the raises:
*2005, 3%;
*2006, 3%;
*2007. 3%;
*2013, 2%;
*2015, 1.5%;
*2018, 3%; and
*2019, 2%.
The state paid half the amount of each raise and localities were responsible for the rest,
There were also two times when Cox voted with the General Assembly to pass teacher pay raises and later supported rescinding them before they went into effect because of low state revenues.
In 2008, Cox backed a 2% raise to start on July 1, 2009. In early 2009, as the state slid into the Great Recession, Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel rescind the pay hike.
In 2016, he supported a 2% to begin July 1, 2017 if projected state revenues didn’t fall more than 1% below projections. Revenues missed that target and in early 2017 Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel the raise.
Overall, Cox unfailingly voted each year for incremental  versions of the state budget that were passed by the Appropriations Committee, the House, and the full General Assembly. Don’t forget that he had an influential role at each step.
Bynum-Coleman’s sources
In her amended second ad, Bynum Coleman offers three citations to back her claim that Cox ""joined special interests to deny teachers a raise."" All of them are at least eight years old. Parker Slaybaugh, Cox’s spokesman, said the speaker doesn’t recall any of the incidents.
One citation is a 2005 bill that would have established a policy goal to raise Virginia teacher salaries to the national average. The bill, which didn’t set a target date to reach the goal or seek money, passed the Senate. It died in House Appropriations Committee that Cox sat on without being brought up for a vote.
There’s no record of any action by Cox on the bill. Rob Silverstein, campaign manager for Bynum-Coleman, said that’s tantamount to Cox opposing raising teacher salaries to the national average. ""He could have moved the bill forward, but he let it die,"" Silverstein said.
Slaybaugh said Cox, in 2005, was a junior member of the 22-person committee and wouldn’t have had the sway to advance the bill. He noted that this summer, Cox called for hitting the national pay average in four years. Silverstein dismissed the action as an election-year stunt.
Bynum-Coleman also cites a failed 2011 bill as evidence of Cox’s opposition to teacher raises.  It would have allowed local school boards to use unspent funds for a one-time bonus teachers bonus up to 3% of their salaries. The legislation died on an unrecorded voice vote in Cox’s seven-member subcommittee.
Bynum-Coleman’s third citation is a confusing editorial that ran in The Virginian-Pilot on Aug. 31, 2008.  It said Cox and two other delegates backed a change in the state school-funding formula ""that would have ended the state’s obligation to pick up a share of supplemental raises awarded by cities and counties."" 
What’s baffling is that the state doesn’t have an obligation - now or then - to pay a portion of teacher raises originating in localities. The opposite is true. We found nothing to corroborate the editorial in a search of state newspapers.
We asked Silverstein if he knew details about the editorial’s statement. ""The story speaks for itself,"" he said.
Special Interests
Key to Bynum-Coleman’s ad is her claim that Cox ""joined special interests"" in ""denying"" teacher pay raises. Our legislative memory, dating to 1986, doesn’t recall any organized lobby against teacher raises. The economy has been the driving force: In good times, teachers usually get raises; in tight times, they don’t.
We asked Silverstein to identify the special interests. He said he was driving and would get back with an answer. We’re still waiting.
Our ruling
Bynum-Coleman’s TV ad says ""Cox joined special interests to deny teachers raises.""  She had to temporarily pull the ad because it claimed Cox voted against a 2013 state budget with a teacher raise when, actually he supported it.
Bynum-Coleman’s corrected ad offers three citations to back her claim, all of them at least seven years old. Two concern the death of bills in the House Appropriations Committee where Cox was a member, One in 2005, would have set an open-ended  goal to raise teacher salaries to the national average; the other would have let school boards spend surpluses in 2013 for a one-time bonus. The third source is two confusing sentences in a 2008 editorial. 
Cox says he doesn’t remember any of these occasions and it would be nice if he did. None of Bynum’s evidence of leads to a recorded vote although Cox, if he followed form, was likely to have gone along with the committee’s Republican majority. And none of her evidence centers on Cox’s actions when there was money on the table for salary increases.
There have been seven budgets since 2005 that raised teacher salaries and Cox voted for each one. Two other times, he supported budgets with pay raises, and a year later voted with the General Assembly to rescind them before they took effect because of flagging state revenues.
All told, Cox’s record matches the legislature’s since 2005. He voted for nine teacher pay hikes and twice to later cancel them.   
Bynum-Coleman offers no proof for her charge Cox joined special interests to stop teacher raises. When you combine this with the erroneous sourcing on her first ad - still posted on her Twitter page - Bynum-Coleman’s full claim is unsubstantiated. 
We rate it Pants on Fire."
6,"""Under @BarackObama illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low.""","on Monday, September 23rd, 2019",http://politifact.com/new-york/statements/2019/sep/23/nathan-mcmurray/mcmurrays-illegal-immigration-claim-only-part-stor/,Mostly False,Nathan McMurray,McMurray’s illegal immigration claim is only part of the story | PolitiFact New York,"Democrat Nate McMurray, who is campaigning for a second time for the 27th Congressional District seat, made a claim recently about illegal immigration during the Obama administration. 
""Under Barack Obama illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low (look it up),"" he said in a  post on Twitter. 
Under @BarackObama illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low (look it up).For the first time, we passed a law on pre-existing conditions and near full healthcare coverage. We recovered from a global economic collapse. I could go on. But @JoeBiden was there too. Fighting.— Nate McMurray (@Nate_McMurray) September 10, 2019 
Immigration continues to be a topic that Americans care about and candidates talk about, so we wanted to see if McMurray is correct. His instruction to ""look it up"" struck us as an invitation for a factcheck.  
What the Grand Island supervisor meant by ""illegal immigration"" remains unclear. His spokesperson did not clarify it for us. Demographers who study immigration look at data from several sources to get a sense of how many people cross the border illegally and how many enter legally but then overstay their visas. They also look at how the population of people who live in the United States without authorization changes over time. That number rises and falls as more undocumented immigrants enter the country while others die, become citizens or leave the country.   
McMurray responded to a Twitter user asking for evidence of his claim, and he tweeted the link to a report from the pro-immigration Center for Migration Studies. 
In the report, ""The U.S. Undocumented Population Fell Sharply During the Obama Era: Estimates for 2016,"" author Robert Warren found that the population of undocumented people fell to 10.8 million in 2016, Obama's last full year in office, the lowest level since 2003. 
The report does not go back 50 years. It does show that the undocumented population was once much lower. Using data on 18 countries that account for 88 percent of the undocumented population, the report shows that in 1990, the undocumented population was 3.5 million, and in 2000 it was 8.6 million. 
Another study, from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, found that the population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007, before Obama took office, at 12.2 million and fell to 10.5 million in 2017, just after he left the presidency. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses a different methodology to count the number of unauthorized immigrants, and it estimates that on average, that number grew by 70,000 people every year between 2010 and 2015. DHS estimates that 12 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States in January 2015, compared to 11.5 million in January 2014 and 11.6 million in January 2010, according to a report published in December. 
Not a perfect measure
We interviewed five people who study immigration trends, some from think tanks with different viewpoints on immigration and others who conduct research but do not take positions on policy. Many of these experts use government data on apprehensions of people who are in the United States without authorization to measure illegal immigration, though they warned that data is not a perfect measure. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports that yearly apprehensions of aliens, which the department defines as people who are not citizens or nationals, was as low as 462,388 under Obama in 2015. The highest number of apprehensions during Obama’s presidency was 889,212 in 2009. This figure includes apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol and administrative arrests by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Before 2015, the department recorded lower apprehensions 44 years earlier. In 1971, 420,126 apprehensions were recorded. After Obama left office, the number of apprehensions fell lower still. In 2017, President Donald Trump’s first year in office, apprehensions fell to 461,540. 
The U.S. Border Patrol also reports its yearly apprehensions, which is a subset of the Department of Homeland Security data. Apprehensions at the border during the Obama administration were also lowest in 2015, at 337,117. Before 2015, apprehensions at the border were lower in 1971, with 302,517. In 2017, border apprehensions fell to 310,531.  
What is at a 50-year low, according to Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, is apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border. However, Passel said that though apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border are falling, research from Pew shows that people who have likely overstayed their visas have made up a large majority of unauthorized immigrant arrivals since 2010.
Several demographers warned that apprehensions are only a rough indicator of illegal immigration, and not just because apprehensions do not reveal the precise number of people who crossed the border without permission and stayed. Research published in January from the Center for Migration Studies found ""visa overstays have significantly exceeded illegal border crossings during each of the last seven years."" 
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, said there are problems with comparing apprehension data over the last 50 years because of changes in the way U.S. Border Patrol deters illegal border crossings. Decades ago, the same people tried several times before they crossed, she said. She also said that the statistics on the number of apprehensions represents events, not people, and that the same person could be apprehended several times. 
When we followed up with McMurray’s campaign for further evidence of his claim, his spokeswoman, Nicole Hushla, said that McMurray had heard the statistic on the MSNBC program ""Morning Joe."" Further questions we had about whether McMurray was talking about apprehensions of undocumented people at the border or about the undocumented population living in the United States were not answered.  
Experts we spoke with gave mixed opinions about whether McMurray’s claim is accurate. 
Warren, who formerly worked for the Census Bureau and has written many research papers that have been widely cited, said in an interview that he believes McMurray’s claim to be ""generally correct,"" based on the same apprehension data.
""Actually, if someone wanted to quibble with the statement, undocumented immigration probably was lower in the late 1960s and early 1970s than it was in the later part of the Obama administration; it was higher from the mid-1970s to the later part of the Obama administration – about 40 years,"" he said. 
Some experts said McMurray’s claim is largely correct, based on apprehensions of people seeking to enter the country illegally, particularly of apprehensions at the southern border. Those figures, however, do not include visa overstays, a large source of illegal immigration.  
""If you define it to mean the size of the unauthorized immigrant population, that’s not accurate,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, which supports liberal immigration policies. ""The size of the unauthorized population overall in the U.S. was at near-record highs during the start of the Obama administration and while it tapered off somewhat, the population remains vastly larger than it was 50 years ago."" 
A researcher with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports Trump’s immigration policies, noted the size of the population of unauthorized immigrants under Obama. Even when illegal immigration was lowest under Obama, that population was still approximately three times larger than it was in 1990, said Spencer Raley, the federation’s senior research associate. Raley also believes that the size of this population is underestimated because the government has trouble collecting accurate data.    
Our ruling
McMurray tweeted that during the Obama administration illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low. 
Nothing in the data we reviewed shows that to be true.
During Obama’s eight-year presidency, apprehensions of people who were in the country without authorization dropped to levels not seen since 1971. Apprehensions are not a precise measure of how many individuals enter the country and stay when they are not authorized to do so, and they do not include people who overstay their visas. But immigration researchers do use this data to make estimates about illegal immigration.  
But even if McMurray had said apprehensions, his statement would have still been problematic. In November 2014, Obama said, ""Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s."" PolitiFact found his statement to be Half True. While PolitiFact found Obama to be correct on the sheer numbers of people caught trying to cross the border in 2013 and the 1970s, experts noted that Obama created an imperfect comparison because the border situation was far different in 1970 than in 2013. In the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple attempts or excursions illegally across the border.
Demographers use the size of the population of illegal immigrants residing in the United States to measure trends in illegal immigration. This population was much lower decades ago, based on available data, than it was during the Obama administration, though some studies show that this population fell during the last 10 years.  
We rate McMurray’s claim Mostly False."

6,"""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas"" to purchase a gun.","on Friday, September 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/sep/20/gina-hinojosa/can-you-have-outstanding-arrest-warrant-murder-and/,Mostly True,Gina Hinojosa,Can you have an outstanding arrest warrant for murder and pass a background check to buy a gun? | PolitiFact Texas,"Democrats in Texas are urging Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to tackle gun violence in the wake of two mass shootings in the state that left 29 people dead.
Lawmakers pushing for the session held a news conference outside of the Texas Capitol in early September, including state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, D-Austin, who made an eye-catching claim about eligibility requirements for gun licenses in the state.
""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas,"" Hinojosa said.
Hinojosa’s staff said her claim is true, since the U.S. Department of Justice adopted a new interpretation for ""fugitive from justice,"" meaning the classification only refers to people wanted by law enforcement who have crossed state lines.
A similar statement was repeated by Democratic state lawmakers during a hearing at the state Capitol on gun legislation at the end of September.
The claim needs more context. In certain cases, someone with an active arrest warrant for murder could legally pass a background check and buy a gun in Texas, but it depends on where and how the warrant was issued.
How do background checks for gun purchases work?
Before we dive into this fact-check, let’s explore the process for running a background check on a prospective gun-purchaser in Texas.
Federal law requires licensed-gun dealers to run background checks on prospective buyers who do not have a license to carry. (A license is required to carry a handgun in public but is not required to purchase a gun.) Private sellers do not have to conduct background checks before making a sale.
A person without a license to carry who is buying a gun in Texas from a licensed dealer must undergo a background check by first providing a photo ID and completing a form produced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine whether the individual falls into any category of person prohibited from purchasing a firearm.
Federal and Texas laws state that a person cannot purchase or possess a firearm if the person has been convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault and the person's release from confinement or supervision occurred within the previous five years.
Certain people with a history of mental illness also are barred from purchasing a gun, as is anyone who is considered a ""fugitive from justice"" — a category we’ll explore more in-depth later.
Texas is not a ""point of contact"" state, which means the FBI runs background checks for prospective purchasers in the state. Once a request has been submitted by a dealer, the FBI has three business days to complete the check. After that period, the sale can go forward — even if the FBI has not completed its review.
The FBI could later issue a ""delayed denial"" if the agency completes the check after the three-day window and discovers that a sale was completed for an individual who should have been barred from buying a gun.
At that point, the case is referred to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for recovering the firearm.
What constitutes a ""fugitive from justice""
Chelsea O’Hara, chief of staff to Hinojosa, said the Democrat’s statement is true under the new federal interpretation of fugitive from justice, a classification that forbids someone from purchasing a firearm.
Before the shift, a person with an active arrest warrant for murder would have fit the definition, but the new interpretation changes things.
O’Hara pointed to a news story about the change and provided a copy of a letter distributed by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) division outlining the claim. She also shared a copy of the ATF form prospective purchasers are required to complete. The form includes the updated definition.
The FBI and ATF had disagreed on who is considered a fugitive from justice since at least 2008, according to a 2016 audit from the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice.
Under the FBI’s original definition, any individual with an outstanding arrest warrant would be unable to buy a gun. But the ATF considered a fugitive from justice only a person who has an outstanding arrest warrant and then leaves the state where the warrant was issued.
In 2017, the Department of Justice sided with the ATF, prompting the FBI to purge the names of tens of thousands of people wanted by law enforcement agencies from its background check database, according to The Washington Post.
A handful of states prevent anyone with an arrest warrant from purchasing a firearm, but Texas is not one of them.
What about people with an arrest warrant for murder?
The FBI’s original definition for fugitive from justice would have included individuals with active warrants for their arrest for murder and other charges, thereby preventing them from buying a gun.
But under the new definition, the existence of an arrest warrant on its own is no longer enough to deny the sale or transfer of a firearm to an individual, according to a statement provided by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System division at the FBI.
In other words, the fugitive from justice statute would not necessarily stop a person with an active arrest warrant for murder issued in Texas from passing a background check to purchase a gun in the state.
But such a person might be stopped by a different portion of the law.
In addition to preventing fugitives from justice or people recently convicted of felonies or certain misdemeanors involving domestic violence from purchasing guns, the law also bars gun purchases for people with active arrest warrants that have ""been issued pursuant to an indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,"" according to ATF spokeswoman Carolyn Gwathmey. This would include murder charges.
Generally, an arrest warrant can be issued at the discretion of a judge or by way of a grand jury indictment, depending on the circumstances of a case. In murder cases, it is more common for a warrant to be issued by a judge than from a grand jury, to get a suspect off the street and into custody as soon as possible.
Jennifer Szimanski, a public affairs officer at the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas and a former detective at the Austin Police Department, said the investigating team might pursue an arrest warrant from a judge if they have ""very strong evidence of a crime being committed and the case appears ironclad.""
She said investigators might pursue an indictment from a grand jury if ""the evidence is not as strong and mostly circumstantial"" but investigators are confident they’ve identified the right suspect.
""So your basic question, can someone wanted for murder roll into a gun store in Texas and buy a gun? The answer is yes — if that person’s warrant was issued just by a judge and doesn’t involve an indictment, and if there is no evidence readily available to the FBI or ATF that (the person) somehow sought to avoid that warrant,"" said David Chipman, a senior policy advisor at the Giffords Law Center and a former special agent at ATF.
The idea behind the policy is that an individual would not lose their ability to access firearms until they have been convicted of a crime, according to John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University.
""It’s certainly true that if there is more (in a person’s history) than just an arrest warrant, you may be curtailed,"" he said. ""But on its face, the statement says if you’re in Texas buying a gun with a warrant for arrest as a Texas resident, you’re probably fine. To me, that seems absolutely ludicrous. But it is the law.""
Our ruling
Hinojosa said, ""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas.""
Hinojosa’s claim needs more context. It’s true that certain people with active arrest warrants for murder could legally pass a background check in Texas and purchase a gun — but only if the warrant was issued prior to an indictment and if it originated in Texas.
If an arrest warrant for murder was the result of an indictment or was issued in another state, the person could not pass a background check.
We rate this claim Mostly True.

6,"""There are 1,600 new coal-fired power plants being constructed as I speak around the world.""","on Friday, September 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/west-virginia/statements/2019/sep/20/cecil-roberts/are-1600-new-coal-fired-power-plants-being-constru/,Mostly False,Cecil Roberts,"Are 1,600 new coal-fired power plants being constructed today? | PolitiFact West Virgin","The president of the United Mine Workers of America  -- a union representing coal miners, many of them in West Virginia -- sees a future for coal in electricity generation despite concern that coal’s carbon emissions could bring about climate change. 
In a Sept. 4 speech at the National Press Club in Washington, the union’s president, Cecil E. Roberts, touted the number of coal-fired power plants being constructed internationally.
Roberts said: ""We need to develop technology to remove carbon from the burning of coal, or you’re never -- write that word down -- never going to resolve climate change. Never. Why is that? There are 1,600 -- 1,600 -- new coal-fired power plants being constructed as I speak around the world.""
That’s a large number. Is it correct? We took a closer look. (The union did not respond to requests for comment.)

 
We found a New York Times article published on July 1, 2017, that said, ""Over all, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries.""
At the very least, the 1,600 figure may be outdated, since it’s more than two years old. So we took a closer look at the sourcing.
The article attributed this data to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, portal published by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM). This group, founded in 2007, has board members from such environmental groups as Clean Energy Action, Greenpeace, and the Rainforest Action Network. (The group did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)
As it turns out, the number on the site today is lower. 
The tracker classifies coal-fired units as being under one of the following categories: announced, cancelled, under construction, mothballed, operating, permitted, pre-permit stage, retired, and shelved. So we looked at the figures using a few combinations of these categories.
There are 458 units currently under construction, according to the tracker -- well below the 1,600 Roberts cited. 

A screen capture shows 458 coal-fired units with site preparation and other activities underway. (Global Coal Plant Tracker)
If you add in those in the permitted or pre-permit stage, the number increases to 903. This number includes plants seeking environmental approvals and other developmental steps, according to the GEM website.

A screen capture shows 903 coal-fired units with permit, pre-permit and under construction. (Global Coal Plant Tracker)
Even if you add in those that are ""announced"" -- which does not really qualify as being ""under construction"" -- it brings the number up to only 1,160. That’s more than one-quarter lower than the figure Roberts cited. (None of these are in the United States.)
Kelly Sims Gallagher, director of the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University, told PolitiFact that other sources of data indicate declining interest in coal-fired power plants.
The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based international organization, found that final investment decisions for new coal power plants have declined steadily between 2015 and 2018.

Gallagher said this separate source of data ""reinforces"" questions about Roberts’ underlying argument -- that the coal power-plant sector is healthy.
Finally, a technical point: The tracker uses the term ""units,"" while Roberts referred to ""plants."" A worldwide survey of coal-fired power plants shows that plants often include several units. 
Our ruling
Roberts said, ""There are 1,600 new coal-fired power plants being constructed as I speak around the world.""
A New York Times article from more than two years ago cited the 1,600 figure, but even then it described units being ""planned or under construction"" -- not strictly under construction. 
In addition, those numbers appear to have shrunk in the succeeding two years. Using the same website as the Times used, there are 458 coal-fired units being built worldwide today, and 903 if you include those in the pre-permitting or permit phase -- significantly less than what Roberts indicated. 
We rate his statement Mostly False."
7,"""Statistics indicate Americans have experienced 29.3 (billion) illegal robocalls so far this year, marking a 64 percent increase since 2016.""","on Friday, September 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/missouri/statements/2019/sep/20/vicky-hartzler/how-many-robocalls-do-americans-get-each-year-its-/,Mostly False,Vicky Hartzler,How many robocalls do Americans get each year? It’s hard to say | PolitiFact Missour,"If there is one issue that unites Republicans and Democrats, it’s robocalls.


The automated calls that have flooded constituents’ phones are prompting congressional action. Over the summer, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, by a vote of 429-3.


The act amends the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify laws against making robocalls, and puts in place call-blocker technology to prevent future calls.


In an Aug. 9 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, endorsed the act, claiming that ""robocalls prey on the most vulnerable among us, including senior citizens.


""Statistics indicate Americans have experienced 29.3 illegal robocalls so far this year, marking a 64 percent increase since 2016,"" Hartzler wrote.


Hartzler’s statement included a typo, spokesperson Anna Swick said. She meant to say 29.3 billion illegal robocalls. That’s a big oopsy. Swick noted that a July 24 news release included the word billion.


But there’s another wrinkle: How many are really considered illegal?


Any phone call that includes a recorded message rather than a live person is considered a robocall, according to the Federal Trade Commission. If the receiver of the call did not give consent to receive it, the call is considered illegal. So that robocall reminding you of a doctor’s appointment is probably OK; the one promising you riches from a foreign prince probably isn’t.


We decided to take a closer look into the robocall issue and find out whether Hartzler’s statement — the one with 29.3 ""billion"" that was intended to run — holds up.


The robocall statistics


In her newsletter, Hartzler used numbers from a robocall blocking app called YouMail that were cited in the report for H.R. 3375. But there’s a big difference between Hartzler’s numbers and YouMail’s, and that is the use of the word ""illegal.""


YouMail CEO Alex Quilici said the app tracks the calls made by its 10 million users and uses their area codes to extrapolate the data for the entire country and specific states. The app then funnels that data into a robocall index.


The app does not, however, distinguish between illegal and legal robocalls. YouMail’s data actually reports 29.3 billion total robocalls from January until the end of July.


YouMail gives four categories of calls: alerts, payment reminders, scams, and telemarketing. So, you could guess that the scams are illegal. But Hartzler’s claim didn’t break it down.


Other databases suggest that robocalls are a problem, but the numbers vary by government agency. The Federal Communications Commission received 232,000 robocall complaints in 2018, according to the House Report. The Federal Trade Commission reported 4.1 million robocall complaints in 2018.


Comparing YouMail data and federal data isn’t exactly apples to apples. YouMail tracks all robocalls received by its app users, while the FCC and FTC only collect complaints. These reports can give some sense of the problem, but they leave out those people who don’t file complaints or use call-blocker apps.


Our ruling


Hartzler stated that robocalls target senior citizens, and that Americans have experienced 29.3 illegal robocalls this year. When asked, her office amended the statement to 29.3 billion.


She said these were illegal calls. Some might be, but not all of them. Because of this key difference, we rate this claim Mostly False."
7,"Says President Trump’s administration has ""actually worsened our nation’s homelessness crisis"" by cutting affordable housing programs, allowing shelters to refuse people based on gender identity or sexual orientation, evicting immigrant families of mixed legal status from subsidized housing and raising rent.","on Friday, September 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/sep/20/tammy-duckworth/trump-policies-duckworth-cited-havent-hurt-housing/,Mostly False,Tammy Duckworth,Trump policies Duckworth cited haven’t hurt housing access — yet | PolitiFact Illinois,"Responding to news President Donald Trump is considering cracking down on homelessness in California, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth blasted his administration for a series of policies she said have exacerbated the problem.
Trump, who has called the state’s burgeoning homelessness crisis ""a disgrace,"" sent officials to Los Angeles last week to find ways to limit the growing number of people living on the streets there.
On Monday, Duckworth re-tweeted a link to a New York Times article about the administration’s efforts, adding her take:
""Just a quick reminder that Trump & @HUDgov have actually *worsened* our nation's homelessness crisis,"" Duckworth wrote, followed by a list of policy actions she claimed had been taken by the administration, including cuts to affordable housing programs, allowing shelters to refuse people based on gender identity or sexual orientation, evicting immigrant families of mixed legal status from subsidized housing and raising rents on low-income individuals.

Trump has indeed proposed changes that match what Duckworth described. Each has been widely criticized for the risk they pose to housing access for some of the nation’s most vulnerable residents.
But none of his proposed policy changes have yet been enacted, and Congress is moving forward with a budget that does not include the steep cuts to housing the president wanted.
Trump — who argued people living on the streets have ruined the ""prestige"" of Los Angeles and San Francisco — has rejected appeals from local officials for more funding to address the issue. He has also said the EPA will issue an environmental notice against San Francisco to address the problem.
After we contacted Duckworth’s office for an explanation, she responded to her original tweet with another within hours. In it, she wrote that she ""should have said they had *tried* to do these four things"" but that Trump and his administration ""have not yet succeeded, despite repeated efforts.""
My earlier tweet is inaccurate. I should have said they had *tried* to do these four things, which is true. The language in the earlier tweet should have said “have sought to worsen our nation's homelessness crisis.” They have not yet succeeded, despite repeated efforts.— Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) September 17, 2019 
Still, we wanted to set the record straight for those who haven’t seen Duckworth’s correction and provide some background on the proposals she cited. Here’s our recap:
‘Cutting programs for affordable housing’ and ‘raising rent’
Trump’s 2020 budget proposed deep cuts for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that called for slashing funds for programs that help low-income people access housing. The proposal was widely described as a nonstarter in Congress, where it met bipartisan disapproval among lawmakers.
This summer, Congress passed a budget to allow for higher levels of government spending with Trump’s support. Lawmakers have not yet finalized the appropriations bills, but advocates we spoke with no longer anticipate housing cuts.
The president's budget was rejected in similar fashion last year. After lawmakers made clear they did not intend to approve Trump’s proposed cuts, HUD Secretary Ben Carson backed off a plan announced that April to increase rent on millions of federal housing assistance recipients.
The proposed legislation called for tripling the rent paid by some of the nation’s poorest households, with minimum rates rising from $50 to $150. Even though it was presented when Republicans held majorities in both the House and Senate, lawmakers have shown little interest in advancing it.
‘Allowing shelters to refuse LGBTQ+ people’ and ‘evicting mixed-status immigrants’
Earlier this year, Trump also proposed federal rule changes to limit housing for the poor. While they do not require congressional approval, the administration cannot greenlight them without undergoing a lengthy review process, which has not yet been completed.
In May, the administration proposed rolling back Obama-era protections that prevent federally funded homeless shelters from discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. If Trump’s plan is approved, it could allow single-sex shelters to deny services to transgender people.
Also this spring, the White House introduced a plan to remove undocumented immigrants and their families from public housing, which a HUD analysis determined could displace more than 55,000 children who are legal U.S. residents or citizens. Current rules prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing subsidies unless their child or spouse is eligible. Landlords and local housing officials have voiced concern over the proposal, which may face legal challenges.
Housing advocates oppose both proposals, along with another Trump plan they argue would make it more difficult to allege housing discrimination in lawsuits under the civil rights-era Fair Housing Act.
Our ruling
Following news Trump is considering cracking down on homelessness in California, Duckworth claimed the president and his housing department have ""worsened our nation’s homelessness crisis"" by cutting affordable housing programs, allowing shelters to refuse people based on gender identity, evicting immigrant families of mixed legal status from subsidized housing and raising rents on people who receive federal housing assistance.
The president’s administration has issued a series of proposals to that effect. But Trump has not yet succeeded in making any of the changes Duckworth described, a point she publicly acknowledged following our inquiry.
We rate her claim Mostly False.

7,"When Rick Scott was governor, Florida ""invested record funding in HIV/AIDS prevention.""","on Friday, September 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/sep/20/rick-scott/florida-sen-rick-scott-misleads-about-record-fundi/,Mostly False,Rick Scott,rida Sen. Rick Scott misleads about “record funding” for HIV prevention | PolitiFact Florid,"An investigative report by The Guardian found that when Sen. Rick Scott was Florida’s governor, he left millions of federal dollars unspent to fight HIV.
That has prompted Scott to renew a familiar and misleading talking point about HIV/AIDS funding during his administration as governor.
Scott’s Senate office told The Guardian, a left-leaning British newspaper, that as governor Scott ""invested record funding in HIV/Aids prevention.""
In 2016 we rated a similar statement by Scott about ""record funding"" Mostly False. Scott was referring to money that almost entirely came from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while only a small slice came from the state budget. 
Scott’s spokespersons did not respond to our questions this time around. They have vaguely pushed back against The Guardian report by repeating the refrain about record funding.
When a reporter for Bay News 9 asked Scott if there was any particular reason the state didn’t use the money he said ""no.""
CDC funding for Florida
There are two key federal pots of money designed for HIV: money from the CDC for prevention and money from the Health Resources and Services Administration, known as the Ryan White funds, for treatment. 
When Scott talks about a record for prevention he is referring to the CDC federal money, which can be used for prevention programs such as testing and condom distribution.
The amount awarded by the CDC during Scott’s tenure rose from about $19.4 million in 2011 to $34.8 million in 2016. (We asked the CDC and the Florida Department of Health for additional dollar amounts for 2017 and 2018 but didn’t hear back.)
We found that Florida did add in some of its own money. The state provided an additional $1.4 million in 2015 for a public awareness campaign, an HIV hotline and four targeted outreach coordinators.
When Scott signed the 2016-17 budget, he noted the state contribution for HIV/AIDS services was upped to $1.65 million — .002% out of a total state budget of $82 billion.
As for the rising CDC federal funding, that wasn’t because of increased efforts by the state. The funding formula takes into account population, so Florida received more CDC funding than any other state except New York and California in 2015. The money also takes into account infection rates and patient population. The Obama administration aimed to strengthen prevention efforts in communities where HIV was the most heavily concentrated.
In other words, Florida received an increase in federal funding because the state needed it. 
Scott rejected a separate source of federal funding that could have helped patients with HIV: expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Increased Medicaid coverage in expansion states drove a nationwide increase in coverage for people with HIV, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Medicaid represents the single-largest source of coverage for people with HIV.
Guardian investigation said Florida returned millions of dollars
The Guardian’s article largely focused on what happened with money Florida received from the Ryan White funds, which provide money for treatment.
Between 2015 and 2017, Florida returned $54 million in unspent money after the state health department failed to secure permission from the Legislature to spend it, the Guardian reported. Scott had a philosophy of refusing federal money in many circumstances.
A Health Resources and Services Administration spokeswoman confirmed for PolitiFact Florida that the state returned the $54 million.
It’s common for states to return money to comply with federal rules. States must spend certain drug rebate funds before they spend the Ryan White grant dollars. 
In 2016, there were 29 states that returned money — anywhere from hundreds to millions of dollars. In 2014 and 2015, Florida returned the highest amounts of any state — $53 million. The next year, Florida returned an additional $767,000.
The Guardian reported that as the state missed out on millions of dollars, the number of new HIV cases increased. 
Jen Kates, an expert on HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told PolitiFact that investments in the right programs can drive down infection rates.
""Broadly speaking, there is definitely a link between investments and the epidemic,"" Kates said. ""I can’t say in this case if what happened with these funds had an impact either way.""
Our ruling
When Scott was governor, Florida ""invested record funding in HIV/Aids prevention.""
Spending on HIV/AIDS prevention dramatically rose during Scott’s tenure as governor, but that was mostly a result of rising federal CDC dollars. The state kicked in a much smaller amount. Those federal dollars rose because Florida, a large state with a rising number of cases, needed the money.
Scott’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False."
7,"Says her office ""uncover(ed) $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats.""","on Friday, September 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/missouri/statements/2019/sep/20/nicole-galloway/galloways-watchdog-bragging-claim-mostly-point/,Mostly True,Nicole Galloway,Galloway’s watchdog-bragging claim is mostly on point | PolitiFact Missour,"When Mike Parson announced his bid to stay in the governor’s seat, Auditor Nicole Galloway had been officially in the running for almost a month.


Galloway cited her accomplishments in her Aug. 12 video candidacy announcement: ""I’m a CPA and a Certified Fraud Examiner. It’s my job to be an independent watchdog for taxpayers. To shine a light on government waste, and I found lots of it. Uncovering $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats.""


Sounds like a lot. We decided to take a closer look at the Democrat’s statement that her office has uncovered $350 million in ""waste and fraud"" and that the discoveries resulted in 40 criminal counts against officials on both sides of the aisle.


The origin of the numbers


When we contacted Galloway’s campaign, a staff member cited the 2018 annual report produced by the auditor’s office. That report is compiled from a running list of audits conducted across the state. The $350 million figure showed up in the report, as did 38 of the alleged criminal counts brought as a result of Galloway’s audits. The campaign showed in news releases additional counts brought after the annual report.


Her office’s press secretary, Steph Deidrick, provided a year-by-year breakdown. It adds up to $356 million from May 2015 to the end of 2018.


Deidrick also provided a chart the office uses to track the number of criminal counts brought as a result of audit findings. The chart listed 19 individuals and tallied up the criminal counts brought against each person; Galloway’s office identified a total of 45 criminal counts, including those filed after the 2018 report.


Waste and fraud


There are 551 audit reports available on the auditor’s website from Galloway’s first full month as auditor in May 2015 to the end of 2018. These reports were used to calculate the total ""waste and fraud"" Galloway said her office uncovered.


We spot-checked individual reports. We also turned to industry professionals to help us understand the terminology.


Sarah Hofmann, spokeswoman of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, explained that within the industry, fraud is a legal term that encompasses deliberate acts that aim to deprive someone of ""property or money by guile, deception or other unfair means.""


Boone County Auditor June Pitchford emphasized that fraud ""generally has an element of illegality"" or deception, while waste can simply be the result of poor management or a lack of due diligence.


For this reason, Hofmann said the distinction Galloway made in her claim that the $350 million was a total of waste and fraud was important. Hofmann said government organizations, in particular, often have ""redundancies, or just places that they’re losing money.""


One example of the fraudulent behavior Galloway uncovered comes from the 2017 audit of Putnam County Memorial Hospital, which uncovered about $92 million in fraudulent lab billing practices. Galloway said the hospital was essentially a shell company.


Hofmann said that shell companies are common examples of fraud known as ""asset misappropriation,"" meaning this $92 million billing scheme would be part of Galloway’s total.


Criminal counts brought as a result of audits


Galloway’s claim that her audits have led to 40 criminal counts against Republicans and Democrats ultimately holds up, though it lacks some important context.


We used Missouri Casenet, a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Missouri, a PDF of charges filed and media accounts to look into the criminal counts brought against the people Galloway indicated in her total.


Our research determined that a total of 52 criminal counts were brought against 19 people as a result of audits from Galloway’s office. Receiving stolen property was the most common criminal charge, with 37 counts. The other charges varied, but included counts of forgery, violations of ethics rules by elected officials and stealing of various amounts.


To check the claim that criminal counts were brought against Republicans and Democrats, we called the cities and counties whose officials faced criminal charges and asked if the offices they held are partisan.


In most cases, the offices are nonpartisan.


Of the 19 individuals charged, only four were elected officials who ran as a Republican or Democrat. Three of those charged were Democrats, and only one was a Republican. The other 15 individuals – or about 79 percent of those charged – were hired employees, nonpartisan appointees or held nonpartisan elected offices.


Our ruling


Galloway said her office ""uncover(ed) $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats.""


Knowledgeable professionals agree that Auditor Galloway uncovers ""waste and fraud,"" and individual examples of what Galloway has uncovered in her years as auditor indicate the $350 million total is reasonable.


Galloway’s audits have resulted in over 50 criminal charges, making her claim of 40 criminal counts accurate. However, while the last part of the claim is technically true – charges have been brought against three Democrats and one Republican official – only four of the 19 individuals charged held partisan offices. For this reason, her claim lacks important context."
7,"Between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were ""turned away"" from the polls in 2016 due to lack of proper identification.","on Thursday, September 19th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-again-wisconsin-voter-id/,Pants on Fire!,Hillary Clinton,"Hillary Clinton way off, again, on Wisconsin voter ID | PolitiFact Wisconsin","Hillary Clinton just can’t quit Wisconsin.
Or, more specifically, can’t quit blaming its voting system for her 2016 electoral defeat.
The former Democratic presidential candidate has repeatedly criticized the state’s voter ID law, which was in place for the first time in the election that pitted Clinton against Republican Donald Trump. And she’s repeatedly found herself at odds with the facts.
In May 2017, Clinton claimed that 200,000 Wisconsinites ""were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote."" We rated that Mostly False.
In March 2019, she then claimed that ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in 2016) because of the color of their skin"" and other factors. That was even farther from the truth and drew a Pants on Fire rating.
Clinton returned to the topic again Sept. 17, 2019, in a speech at George Washington University. She listed reasons ""you can win the popular vote and you can lose the Electoral College,"" starting with what she called voter suppression.
""Experts estimate that anywhere from 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin citizen voters, predominantly in Milwaukee, were turned away from the polls,"" Clinton said. ""That’s a lot of potential voters. They showed up, but maybe they didn’t have the correct form of identification. Maybe the name on their driver’s license included a middle name or an initial that wasn’t on their voter registration. But officials made every excuse in the book to prevent certain people from voting in that election.""
That’s a lot of people to be ""turned away"" from polling places.
So let’s recap this. Again.
Spoiler alert: Clinton’s numbers still aren’t anywhere close to accurate.
What the studies said
Clinton’s team didn’t respond to our request for evidence, but the vastly different numbers she cites — 27,000 and 200,000 — roughly reflect two analyses that examined voter ID impact in the 2016 election.
Even the low end of that range, if true, could have made a huge difference. Clinton lost Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes out of about 2.8 million cast. Wisconsin flipped to the Republican side — a key reason Trump won the election.
A May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama, looked at changes in voter turnout and connected them to changes in voter ID law. They said turnout increased by 1.3% from 2012 to 2016 in states with no change to voter ID laws, but dropped in Wisconsin by 3.3%.
If Wisconsin’s turnout had instead risen by 1.3%, Priorities USA estimated that would generate 200,000 more votes. The analysis called these the ""theoretical 200,000 lost voters.""
But that’s very different than tallying specific people ""turned away"" from the polls, as Clinton claimed.
In any case, the 200,000 has its own problems. Experts we’ve quoted in past fact checks said it’s not reasonable to attribute all the changes in turnout to the voter ID law when general enthusiasm — including for Clinton’s candidacy — and other factors doubtless played a role.
The University of Wisconsin conducted a study that could be what Clinton relied on for the low end of the range. It involved a survey of 293 registered voters who didn’t vote in Dane and Milwaukee counties in the 2016 election.
The study estimated a total 12,000 registrants were affected by the ID requirement in those two counties.
But its findings don’t at all match how Clinton phrased her claim, according to the author.
""Our measure captures people who both say they were turned away but also people who didn’t even bother because they didn’t think they could vote,"" Kenneth R. Mayer, a professor of American Politics at UW told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Our estimate is that it’s plausible to think that the voter ID law reduced overall turnout somewhere in the range of 1% in these counties, but that doesn’t get you anywhere close to (Clinton’s) numbers."" 
A news release announcing the study also noted most of the respondents who said they did not vote because they lacked ID ""actually possessed a qualifying form of ID."" That makes it even more ridiculous to group those people into the ""turned away"" category as Clinton did, since they would not in fact have been turned away based on ID if they went to the polls.
How many were really ‘turned away’?
Mayer said he saw anecdotal reports of people being turned away, and the UW study asked people if that happened to them.
The study reported 1.4% of those surveyed said they were told at a polling place their ID was inadequate. That would be four out of the 293.
""It was small enough that we regarded it as not material to the overall conclusion,"" Mayer said.
Firmer numbers are hard to come by.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission reported 821 ID-related provisional ballots were cast statewide in the 2016 election. Those are people who showed up without proper ID but cast a vote anyhow. If the person follows up to provide the correct ID by the Friday following the election, the ballot then counts.
Not everyone who showed up without ID would cast such a ballot, of course. But it’s one measure of how often ID issues surfaced at the polls.
Mayer said we simply don’t know how many people were turned away. But he said Clinton’s number isn’t realistic.
""There is no possibility that (200,000) happened, because that would have been on the order of 60 people per polling place,"" he said, referencing the state’s roughly 3,500 polling locations.
Will Flanders, research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, has criticized the UW survey for having a small sample size and focusing only on Democratic strongholds, among other elements. He said that makes Clinton’s exaggeration of the study’s findings even more extreme.
""Given the problematic nature of that (UW) estimate, estimates that are larger than that are even more out of the realm of reasonable possibility,"" Flanders told PolitiFact Wisconsin.
Our ruling
Clinton said between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were ""turned away"" from the polls in 2016 due to lack of proper identification.
But studies examining voter ID here say nothing of the sort.
They looked broadly at how voter turnout changed — which includes the far larger number who simply stayed away. Experts say there is no reliable number for how many were physically turned away, but the existing work leaves no doubt it’s far short of the range cited by Clinton.
This is the third time we have rated claims from Clinton on the Wisconsin turnout. She’s no closer on this one than the last one.
We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
7,"Says Ilhan Omar ""partied"" on the anniversary of 9/11.","on Thursday, September 19th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/19/donald-trump/trump-retweets-false-claim-ilhan-omar-partied-911-/,Pants on Fire!,Donald Trump,Trump retweets false claim that Ilhan Omar partied on 9/11 anniversary,"President Donald Trump retweeted a post that falsely claimed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was out partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. 
The allegation came via a video posted by conservative comedian Terrence Williams, who falsely declared that Omar ""partied on the anniversary of 9/11."" 
In his video, Williams weighed in on footage of Omar dancing in a crowd to the song ""Truth Hurts"" by Lizzo. But the tape of Omar dancing wasn’t filmed on Sept. 11. 
It actually came from an event hosted two days later, on Sept. 13, by Omar and four other first-term congresswomen who are members of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
The backstory
The footage of Omar dancing was first posted to Twitter on the night of the event by Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a political action committee. ""Can someone name something better than @IlhanMN dancing to @lizzo?"" Green wrote. ""Because I can’t think of anything.""

Jeremy Slevin, communications director for Omar, shared a copy of a flyer advertising the event, which was billed as lasting two hours and titled ""Breaking Concrete Ceilings.""
Three days after the event, on Sept. 16, Williams uploaded his own video in a tweet that claimed Omar, a Muslim, ""partied on the anniversary of 9/11.""
""What in the world were you celebrating on the anniversary of 9/11?"" Williams said in the video, which showed the recording of Omar, according to FactCheck.org. ""You were seriously partying on the anniversary of 9/11? Turning up, while millions of Americans were at home mourning all the lives that were lost."" 
On Sept. 18, Trump retweeted Williams’ video and said Omar is ""the new face of the Democratic Party"" and ""will win us the great state of Minnesota.""
IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party! https://t.co/aQFEygSa4D— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019 
Omar responded roughly two hours later. 
""This is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress,"" she wrote. ""The president of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk. What is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?""

Williams’ claim was quickly debunked by journalists and fact-checkers, and Omar tweeted a few more times about Trump spreading it. She also retweeted a petition from Green’s political action committee urging Twitter to suspend Trump’s account until he removes his tweet.
The video has since been removed from Williams’ Twitter and Facebook accounts. But Williams, who did not respond to a request for comment, doubled down on his criticisms of Omar, calling in a series of tweets for her to be impeached for labeling Trump a racist. (Members of Congress can be expelled by their respective chamber, but they cannot be impeached.) 
For his part, Trump tweeted about Williams twice more the same morning he shared the attack on Omar. In August, he also retweeted a video in which Williams suggested without evidence that Bill and Hillary Clinton were behind the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.   
Trump has spread falsehoods related to Omar before, wrongly claiming in July that she was ""speaking about how wonderful al-Qaeda is."" Omar drew criticism from some quarters in March for saying ""some people did something"" in reference to the attacks on the World Trade Center.
The Trump campaign declined to comment.
For the record, Omar spent at least part of her night on Sept. 11 speaking alongside Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference, according to a video on her Facebook page. 
Slevin said Omar did not attend the other receptions put on for the conference that evening, and he confirmed that she was not dancing at any other event held that day.
Slevin also said Omar went to committees and votes during the day. We counted at least six votes she cast in the House between about 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 11.
Our ruling
Trump retweeted a post that said Ilhan Omar ""partied"" on the anniversary of 9/11.
The bogus allegation, shared by a comedian with an assist from Trump, who broadcast it to his 64 million Twitter followers, was based on a video that shows Omar dancing at a Congressional Black Caucus event. But the event was hosted on Sept. 13, not on Sept. 11.

7,"""Wisconsin is currently seeing an influx of new residents, Illinois is seeing an outflux.""","on Thursday, September 19th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/19/mark-perry/illinois-population-loss-wisconsins-gain/,Mostly True,Mark Perry,Illinois population loss is Wisconsin's gain | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Since when did Wisconsin become a magnet for residents from its neighbors to the south?
According to Mark J. Perry, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, Wisconsin’s economy and strong job market are driving people from Illinois to move here.
""Wisconsin is currently seeing an influx of new residents, Illinois is seeing an outflux,"" Perry said on 1130 WISN’s Jay Weber Show on June 28, 2019, suggesting it’s because of Wisconsin’s low unemployment rate and job openings.
Perry’s claim comes from a study he conducted for the Badger Institute, a conservative think tank, titled ""Leaving Illinois for Wisconsin: An analysis of the accelerating outbound migration across the border to the Badger State."" 
We’ve seen the Cubs gear at Miller Park, but figured most of those fans were just visiting. 
How many Illinoisians are trading the Land of Lincoln for the Badger State? 
And does his claim account for Wisconsinites who are moving south of the border? 
We decided to take a look.
How the study was conducted
To conduct the study, Perry used numbers from the Census Bureau’s annual reports of  inbound and outbound migration for each state. 
""All of that is publicly available data and information that I just got from various government sources,"" Perry told PolitiFact Wisconsin. 
The Wisconsin/Illinois study was part of a wider study Perry conducted on nationwide migration patterns.
To find data for the state-to-state migration flows, the Census Bureau asks respondents about everyone age 1 year and over and whether they lived in the same residence a year ago. If the person lived somewhere else, they are asked to say where they moved from. 
In 2017, when all migration is considered, Wisconsin had 112,519 move in and 113,492 move out, a net loss of less than 1,000 people. (Of course, there are other factors in overall population changes -- births and deaths).
Looking strictly at migration changes, Wisconsin’s net outflow of 973 people in 2017 puts the state  around the middle of the pack. All told, there were 21 states that lost more people to migration that year. 
Florida saw the biggest boost via net migration, adding 118,890, while New York took the biggest hit with 167,328 more leaving than coming.
Wisconsin vs. Illinois
The picture changes for Wisconsin when you look strictly at Illinois -- there a big gap emerges.
According to the Census Bureau’s most recent data from 2017, Illinois had a population of almost 12.7 million, compared to Wisconsin’s 5.7 million.
In 2017, 26,963 people moved from Illinois to Wisconsin, according to the census bureau’s migration data. Meanwhile, 12,274 moved from Wisconsin to Illinois. That means Wisconsin picked up a net 14,689 people from Illinois in 2017 alone.
(To be sure, there are a lot more people in Illinois who may be on the move. The state has more than twice the population of Wisconsin.)
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
That means 297,812 people left Illinois for Wisconsin between 2006 to 2017 and 181,419 left Wisconsin for Illinois in the same time period. That leaves a net flow of 116,393, which matches Perry’s study.
And his claim.
Researching the process
We also asked researchers who have worked on similar migration studies how they go about conducting a study using these kind of numbers.
Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the CATO Institute, who conducted his own study on interstate migration, used census numbers and Internal Revenue Service numbers for the process.
For Perry’s study, Edwards said the question should remain in whether Wisconsin is really as strong of a location in attracting business when it also has a steady outflow.
""The data is accurate,"" Edwards said. ""The flows are accurate. The debate really is why people are moving.""
Our rating
Perry claimed ""Wisconsin is currently seeing an influx of new residents, Illinois is seeing an outflux.""
He indicated he was speaking about the flow between the two states, with Wisconsin picking up a net 116,000 residents from Illinois between 2006 and 2017.
But a caveat is in order:
Listeners could be left with the idea Wisconsin is booming in this regard. In reality, when all states and locations are taken in, Wisconsin ranks in the middle of the pack, based on the most recent numbers, from 2017.
Our definition for Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here."

But a photo circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Ivanka’s brand lives on and is exempt from the tariffs her father, President Donald Trump, has imposed on China.  
The photo appears to show a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes with the label ""made in China"" and a stamp that says ""tarriff exempt."" (The first clue that this image was tampered with? The word ""tariff"" is misspelled.) 
The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The image has been altered and its message is inaccurate. Ivanka Trump’s brand is no longer operating, although her company received preliminary approval from the Chinese government for five trademarks in Jan. 2019, which some say could help her resume her business after Trump leaves office. 
After running a reverse-image search, we found that the image of the box has been cropped from a larger photo published by Gawker in March 2016. 
The original photo does include the ""made in China"" stamp, but the misspelled ""tariff exempt"" imprint seen in the Facebook post’s version is not there.

 
While her father’s latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods largely targets electronics, Ivanka Trump’s brand likely would be affected if it were still in operation because the items to be taxed also include many types of footwear. 
Our ruling
An image posted on Facebook claims to show a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes made in China with a tariff exempt stamp. 
The image is old, Ivanka’s fashion line is now defunct, and the photo was manipulated to include the misspelled stamp.

Elizabeth Warren has vowed to tackle the college affordability crisis if elected president by forgiving student loan debts and making tuition-free college a reality.
But a misleading image circulating social media seems to suggest that Warren is partially responsible for the soaring college prices she’s pledging to trim down.
The image, which we found online and on Twitter and Facebook, shows a quote attributed to Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall.com, a conservative news website. 
The quote reads: ""As Elizabeth Warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students, just remember she was paid $400,000 to teach one class.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We traced the quote back to Pavlich, who tweeted it on July 30 during the Democratic primary debates in Detroit. But we wondered whether the substance of her claim was accurate.
As Elizabeth Warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students, just remember she was paid $400,000 to teach one class.— Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) July 31, 2019 
In short, we found that Warren did make more than $400,000 for her work at Harvard Law School over a two-year span. But it’s wrong to suggest that all she did was teach one class, and the claim leaves out important context about the other work Warren was doing at that time.
Warren’s time at Harvard
Pavlich did not respond to a request for comment, but a quick Google search turned up a handful of news reports from 2012 detailing the financial disclosure forms Warren released as part of her first bid for the Senate in Massachusetts.
According to those filings, Warren earned $429,981 in salary from Harvard during 2010 and 2011. She also made money from book royalties and consulting fees.
Warren spent roughly two decades lecturing at Harvard Law School, where students recognized her with multiple teaching awards, according to the university’s faculty directory. She taught commercial law as a visiting professor for a year before accepting a tenured position in 1995.
Generally speaking, university professors — especially at major research institutions like Harvard — are hired not only to teach, but also to do research and be campus leaders. 
In fact, a 2017 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that, for university professors, ""salaries are determined principally by research output and associated reputation,"" rather than the number of students the professor teaches.
Harvard Law School declined to comment, but the university pays professors more than most research universities, with the average salary for full-time professors being $226,394 in 2017, $203,699 in 2011 and $194,136 in 2010, per the Chronicle of Higher Education. Recent tax filings show that Warren’s husband, also a Harvard law professor, earned $402,897 in 2018.
According to an archived version of Harvard Law School’s course catalog, Warren taught one class on empirical analysis during the 2010 spring semester, and local and university news reports indicate that she also taught another class on contracts during the 2011 fall semester. 
In September 2010, former President Barack Obama tapped Warren to temporarily oversee the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency set up in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers from financial tricks. 
Warren left Harvard to fill this role and did not return to campus until July 2011, meaning she was unavailable to teach during the 2010 fall and 2011 spring semesters. 
In a statement to PolitiFact, the Warren campaign noted how Warren taught multiple classes during most other semesters. For example, she taught four classes during the 2006-07 academic year, three in 2007-08, and three in 2008-09. 
But even if Warren taught fewer classes than usual in 2010 and 2011, saying she ""was paid $400,000 to teach one class"" discounts the research she produced that year and in years previous. In 2010, for example, she contributed a chapter to a book on government regulation.
It also ignores the fact that Warren stepped aside from teaching for the entire 2010-11 academic year to advise the Obama administration as an expert on bankruptcy.
Our ruling
A viral image said Warren ""was paid $400,000 to teach one class.""
Warren earned more than $400,000 for her work as a Harvard Law School professor in 2010 and 2011. Across those two years, she taught two classes, not one. She also left Harvard during the 2010-2011 academic year to advise the government.
Plus, her $400,000 salary would have reflected not only her work in the classroom, but also her reputation, her contributions to Harvard as a researcher and her many years at the university.

Is it true that Barack Obama’s administration did not carry out workplace raids, but rather ended them? Biden is partially correct. 
Obama ended the large-scale arrests of immigrants at their workplaces, prioritizing instead the prosecutions of employers who hired unauthorized workers. But some immigrants were still arrested when agents showed up to workplaces to execute search warrant against employers.
Arrests of unauthorized immigrants in the workplace
Immigration law prohibits employers from knowingly hiring people who are not legally authorized to work. Employers are required to verify employees’ identities and work eligibility, and to complete and retain related verification forms known as I-9.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, enforces provisions of the law through ""worksite enforcement"" operations. ""Raid"" is the colloquial word used when ICE arrests a large number of people at a workplace or elsewhere.
Raids during Bush, Obama
During President George W. Bush’s second term in office, ICE agents arrested hundreds of immigrants at a time, often in factories and meat processing plants. One of the most high-profile raids happened in 2008 at a meatpacking plant in Iowa, when agents descended in helicopters and arrested nearly 400 workers.
In April 2009, about three months into Obama’s first term, ICE announced a new focus on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hired workers illegally in the country. Arresting and removing workers alone was insufficient, an ICE memo said, and focusing on employers would target the root causes of illegal immigration. The agency also said it would continue to arrest and deport unauthorized workers encountered during operations.
Instead of conducting massive raids at worksites, ICE under Obama focused on audits of employers’ I-9 forms to determine if they complied with immigration law. ICE followed-up some cases with onsite law enforcement.
Media reports in 2010 and 2011 said the ICE audits became known as ""silent raids,"" often leading to employees being fired once their employers were notified by ICE of irregularities on the I-9 forms. (ICE gives employers time to correct any errors on the forms.)
Government data on worksite enforcement operations shows that the number of individuals arrested on immigration law violation charges declined after Obama took office.

ICE spokesman Paul Prince told PolitiFact that the arrest data didn’t exclusively mean that that many people were arrested on site, though it could be the case in some instances. (For instance, someone might have been arrested elsewhere, but stemming from the findings of the workplace investigation.)
A June 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service said that it was unclear why there was an overall decrease from 2008 to 2014 in worksite arrests for immigration charges and criminal charges, ""but they may reflect, to some degree, ICE’s stated renewed focus on employers.""
Given the data on immigrants arrested in worksite enforcement operations, Biden is wrong to claim that there were zero ""workplace raids,"" said Rey Koslowski, an expert on immigration and associate professor at the University at Albany, State University of New York.
But Biden is correct in that the Obama administration ended the Bush administration’s practice of maximizing the number of employees arrested during workplace raids, often in the hundreds at a time, while failing to prosecute many of their employers, Koslowski said. The Obama administration shifted to targeting employers (though unauthorized workers present during operations were also arrested), he said.
After the August arrests of nearly 700 people in Mississippi, John Sandweg, a former ICE acting director during the Obama administration, told NPR that during their ""employer-centric focus,"" they ""were not going to waste resources apprehending people who are showing up for work unless those individuals had ... some indication that they posed a public safety threat.""
Prince, the ICE spokesman, said that ICE’s strategy ""continues to focus on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly break the law and on the use of I-9 audits and civil fines to encourage compliance with the law.""
Our ruling
Biden said, ""The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them.""
The Obama administration ended the practice of large-scale raids in which hundreds of immigrants were arrested at a time. Obama prioritized the prosecution of employers who knowingly hired unauthorized workers. This was done through increased audits of I-9 forms. But that doesn’t mean there were no onsite operations. In some cases, workers were arrested when ICE agents executed search warrants.
Biden’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True."
7,"""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can’t buy one himself due to his criminal record.""","on Wednesday, September 18th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/sep/18/facebook-posts/would-beto-orourkes-criminal-history-prevent-him-p/,False,Facebook posts,Does Beto O'Rourke's 'criminal record' mean he can't buy a gun? | PolitiFact Texas,"Democrat Beto O’Rourke doubled down on his pitch to institute a mandatory gun buyback program for assault-style weapons during the third debate of the presidential primary in Houston.
""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O’Rourke said at the debate. "" We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.""
His comments were met with boisterous applause from the audience at Texas Southern University and he was on the receiving end of a threatening remark from a state lawmaker in Texas.
They also sparked a questionable Facebook post, shared the day after the debate. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The post included a popular meme that is derived from stills of Drake’s 2015 music video for ""Hotline Bling."" The meme traditionally features two images of the singer and corresponding text generated by the poster. The idea is to make it appear as though Drake is shunning the first phrase, but welcoming the second.
In the post in question, the first phrase is: ""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate the guns because he’s a liberal.""
The second, which Drake seems to signal his approval of, reads: ""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can’t buy one himself due to his criminal record.""
The text of the post says: ""That burglary and DWI will get you every time.""
We’ve looked at O’Rourke’s arrest record in the past, but is he ineligible to purchase a gun, as the post suggests?
Both DWI, burglary arrests were dismissed
O’Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s — for, what he describes as, jumping a fence on the campus at the University of Texas at El Paso and for driving while intoxicated.
He was first arrested in May 1995 on the UTEP campus for attempted forcible entry, according to a copy of the police report provided by O’Rourke’s campaign in 2018. The charge fell under the burglary portion of the state penal code, section 30.02.
O’Rourke told the El Paso Times in 2005 that UTEP ""decided not to press charges"" and a LexisNexis background check of O’Rourke shows that the Class B misdemeanor was dismissed.
In September 1998, O’Rourke was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town outside El Paso.
A witness told police officers that they observed O’Rourke driving at a high speed before losing control of his car and striking a truck, according to a police report of the incident. O’Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him, according to the report.
Law enforcement arrived and arrested O’Rourke, recording that he scored a 0.136 and 0.134 on a breathalyzer test, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time.
O’Rourke was charged with a misdemeanor DWI, but the charge was dismissed after he completed a misdemeanor diversion program in 1999.
In summary: O’Rourke was arrested for two separate misdemeanors in the 1990s, including one for a DWI. Both cases were dismissed.
O’Rourke could purchase a gun
There is no requirement for a person to have a permit or license to purchase rifles and shotguns or handguns in Texas, O’Rourke’s home state. As long as a purchaser is older than 18 and, in certain cases, passes a background check, the person can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. (A permit is required to carry a handgun in public.)
Licensed-gun dealers are required by federal law to conduct a background check for an individual seeking to purchase a gun if that person does not have a license to carry. But private sellers do not have the same requirement.
Federal and state laws in Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or convicted of certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault.
Certain people with a history of mental illness are also barred from purchasing a gun.
O’Rourke would be able to purchase a gun, since he was not convicted of burglary or of driving while intoxicated — both charges were dismissed.
Even if he had been convicted, neither charge would prevent him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, since they were both misdemeanor offenses unrelated to domestic violence and were resolved more than five years ago.
O’Rourke could also obtain a gun license
Misdemeanor DWI offenses play a more significant role when it comes to obtaining a license to carry in Texas.
State law allows for people, not including those in the prohibited categories outlined above, to possess a handgun in their home or in their car without a license to carry. People can also carry rifles and shotguns in public without a permit.
In order to purchase a gun without a background check and to carry a handgun in public, a person must obtain a license to carry from the state.
Requirements for obtaining such a license are more stringent than those for simply purchasing a gun.
Most important in O’Rourke’s case is a requirement that a person is not currently facing charges for ""a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense"" and a requirement that an individual ""has not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense.""
The law also states that a person is not eligible to receive a license to carry if the person has been ""convicted two times within the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a license of an offense of the grade of Class B misdemeanor or greater that involves the use of alcohol or a controlled substance as a statutory element of the offense.""
O’Rourke was arrested on a burglary charge in 1995, a misdemeanor offense that was dismissed. He was arrested for DWI in 1998, a misdemeanor offense that also was dismissed after he completed a diversion program.
Neither arrest, taken separately or together, would prevent him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Texas law.
""He has no convictions on his record, so there is zero collateral consequence, vis-à-vis his ability to get a gun license,"" said Steve Toland, an Austin-based defense attorney who handles DWI cases.
The Texas Department of Public Safety, which administers the licensing program, lists answers to frequently asked questions on its website, including one about how dismissed charges affect eligibility.
""If charges were dismissed without prosecution, then they are not disqualifying,"" the post reads.
If O’Rourke’s misdemeanor DWI had not been dismissed and he had been convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a gun license today, since more than five years have passed.
Had O’Rourke applied for a license after his arrests, when the charges were still pending, he would not have been eligible for a gun license. But since he was not convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a license once his cases had been dismissed.
Our Ruling
A Facebook post circulating after the Democratic debate said that O’Rourke can’t buy a gun ""due to his criminal record.""
O’Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s — for burglary and DWI. Both cases were dismissed and he was not convicted of either charge.
O'Rourke could have passed a gun-purchase background check and obtained a license to carry once the charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted of these charges, he still could purchase a gun today.
We rate this claim False.

No. This claim is a version of one of the many myths that have revolved around the word ""news"" for years. 
First, Merriam-Webster does not reference any acronyms for newspaper, defining it as a ""paper that is printed and distributed usually daily or weekly and that contains news, articles of opinion, features, and advertising"" It defines the word news as a ""report of recent events"" with the first usage dating back to the 15th century. 
The dictionary also set the record straight on Twitter in 2017 when a similar claim that said news stood for ""notable events, weather and sports"" circulated on the platform:
No.— Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) June 7, 2017 
As well, the Online Etymology Dictionary makes no mention of acronyms for ""news"" or ""newspaper,"" and says news was derived from the French ""nouvelles,"" meaning new things. The database also calls the ""north, east, west, south"" theory ""absurd folk-etymology:""
""Late 14c., ‘new things,’ plural of new (n.) ‘new thing’ (see new (adj.)); after French nouvelles, which was used in Bible translations to render Medieval Latin nova (neuter plural) ‘news,’ literally ‘new things.’
The English word was construed as singular at least from the 1560s, but it sometimes still regarded as plural 17c.-19c. The odd and doubtful construction probably accounts for the absurd folk-etymology (attested by 1640 but originally, and in 18c. usually, in jest-books) that claims it to be an abbreviation of north east south west, as though ‘information from all quarters of the compass.’""
The word paper alone has origins in the Latin word ""papyrus,"" the stalks used to make paper, and the Greek word ""papyros."" 
This claim is a repurposed hoax. We rate it Pants on Fire!"
7,"Milwaukee has less taxing power than most similar cities and is the only U.S. city of 400,000 or more ""that does not have a sales tax or local income tax.""","on Wednesday, September 18th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/18/tom-barrett/barrett-overshoots-claim-about-milwaukee-tax-rates/,Half-True,Tom Barrett,Barrett overshoots on claim about Milwaukee tax rates | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Citing stagnant revenue from the state and an increasing financial pinch, Milwaukee-area leaders are pushing the state to sign off on a 1% county sales tax.
The move, which could bring in as much as $160 million per year, would raise the sales tax in Milwaukee County to 6.5%. Officials want to introduce a binding referendum allowing residents to decide on the tax increase themselves, but in Wisconsin the Republican-controlled Legislature must also sign off on the plan.
So people like Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, must make the case to both voters and political opponents why this tax hike is needed. Here is what he said in doing so on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront.""
""In many, many other states, you’ve got different treatment for the largest metropolitan area,"" Barrett said in his Sept. 15, 2019 appearance. ""We are, the last time I checked, the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that doesn’t have either a sales tax or a local income tax. We are just hamstrung because of the rules of the state.""
So Barrett is making the general case that Milwaukee has less flexibility than its peers, while specifically claiming no other city of its size gets by without a local tax of some kind.
We’ll examine both of those.
Is Milwaukee uniquely limited?
The first element of Barrett’s claim is that Milwaukee doesn’t have the same options for raising tax revenue as other large cities.
For more than a century, Wisconsin has used state income and sales taxes to provide aid — called shared revenue — to local governments, while generally not allowing local governments to levy those taxes themselves, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group. The main exception is a half-cent ""piggyback"" sales tax counties are allowed to levy on the same items taxed by the state. Other exceptions include stadium districts.
The current sales tax throughout Milwaukee County is 5.6%, which includes a 5% state sales tax, a 0.5% county sales tax (since 1991) and a 0.1% stadium tax for Miller Park (since 1996). The stadium tax is expected to end by next year.
Many other states don’t have such an oversight requirement, giving local government the freedom to make independent decisions on tax increases.
Some examples:
In Hillsborough County, Florida, which includes Tampa, voters passed two referendums in late 2018 that raised sales taxes by 1.5 cents on the dollar for transportation and schools.
The Albuquerque City Council voted in 2018 to impose a three-eighths cent tax, raising about $52 million per year.
The large Hennepin and Ramsey counties around the Twin Cities voted to levy a half-cent sales tax for transportation in 2017, raising about $100 million annually between the two counties.
But not all states have such a system.
The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, reports 37 states allow local governments to impose their own general sales taxes.
Wisconsin is tricky to categorize. 
Counties may choose to adopt the 0.5% county sales tax, but not all of them do. The state Department of Revenue reports Manitowoc, Menominee, Outagamie, Racine, Waukesha and Winnebago counties have no county sales tax.
The Tax Policy Center lists Wisconsin among the states that allow local sales taxes. But a  2017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum (then the Public Policy Forum) listed Wisconsin among the states with no local sales tax power, since only counties have that ability and it’s capped at 0.5%.
That policy forum report noted this has caused increasing problems in Milwaukee:
""Wisconsin’s strong state aid historically has compensated for the lack of local revenue diversity. However, cutbacks in shared revenue have diminished this program’s purchasing power and required Milwaukee to lean heavily on increased property taxes and fees to offset the impact.""
A 2019 policy forum report said stagnant shared revenue combined with state caps on property taxes has led to mounting questions about ""whether local officials can sustain appropriate service levels in areas such as public safety, streets, libraries and parks.""
The only large city without local sales or income tax?
This brings us to Barrett’s more specific claim — that Milwaukee is the only city of 400,000 or more in the nation without a local sales or income tax.
The 2017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum compared Milwaukee to 38 peer cities around the country. They reported 30 of those cities had a general local sales tax, and the remaining eight each drew revenue from a ""selective sales taxes and/or other forms of taxation besides the property tax.""
That report excluded cities like Indianapolis and Boston from the comparison since they have different funding mechanisms than Milwaukee. Indianapolis performs some typical county functions, and Boston has school district funds pass through its budget.
We asked Barrett’s office for details on where his claim originated, and they forwarded us to Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Department of City Development. He said Barrett’s claim was based on that policy forum report.
But Barrett referred to cities by size, not to the limited peer group in the study. And that makes a difference.
Boston has a population well over 400,000 and does not have a local sales tax or income tax, according to an August 2019 report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.
We’ll assume Barrett was referring to cities that don’t levy their own local sales tax, since otherwise Milwaukee wouldn’t meet his criteria given that city residents are subject to the county’s local sales tax.
And in that case other cities join Boston on the list of exceptions to Barrett’s claim.
Indianapolis does not levy its own sales or income tax, but Marion County imposes a local income tax there, according to the Tax Foundation. And Portland, Oregon, has no city-issued sales or income tax, but residents there pay an income tax to a regional transportation district.
Our ruling
Barrett said Milwaukee faces unusual taxing challenges and is ""the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that does not have a sales tax or local income tax.""
Barrett is essentially on target with the general claim that Milwaukee is in the minority nationally. Wisconsin is one of about a dozen states that authorizes cities to assess only property taxes — not sales or income taxes.
But his core statistical claim is wrong. Several other cities larger than 400,000 do not impose their own sales or income tax.
We define Half True this way: ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""
That fits here."
7,"Dan Helmer ""believes in abolishing our private insurance system.""","on Wednesday, September 18th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/sep/18/tim-hugo/tim-hugo-misstates-dan-helmers-position-private-he/,Mostly False,Tim Hugo,Tim Hugo misstates Dan Helmer's position on private health insurance | PolitiFact Virgin,"Tim Hugo, the last-standing Republican state delegate in Northern Virginia, is telling voters that Democratic challenger Dan Helmer wants to abolish private health insurance.
Hugo has made the claim in at least four campaign mailings in the 40th House District, which spans portions of Fairfax and Prince William Counties. Here’s a sampling:
""While my opponent believes in abolishing our health care system entirely and replacing it with a plan that will cost taxpayers trillions of dollars, I believe we can make improvements to our current system while protecting private insurance,"" Hugo wrote in a Sept. 10 letter.
""Dan Helmer wants to END PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"" Hugo says in big brown letters on a glossy mailer.
""Dan Helmer supports abolishing our private health care insurance and creating a massive government-run system,"" says another mailer with a caricature of a shrunken Helmer behind a podium.
""Now, (Helmer) wants to completely abolish our private health care system and replace it with a big, expensive government-controlled system that taxpayers like us will have to pay,"" Hugo says in another mailer that calls Helmer ""extremist.""
A website run by the fundraising Friends of Tim Hugo says, ""Dan supports a (medical insurance) plan that would cost taxpayers trillions of dollars. And if that’s not bad enough, Dan’s plan would also take away people’s private insurance.""
We fact-checked Hugo’s repeated claim.
Hugo, in one of his mailers, says his source is a May 2018 ad by Helmer when he ran unsuccessfully for Democratic nomination for 10th Congressional District seat. Helmer finished fourth in a six-person primary won by Jennifer Wexton, who went on to win the general election.
""I’m for a Medicare-for-All option,"" Helmer says in the ad. The bottom of the screen says ""DAN HELMER MEDICARE FOR ALL."" Unlike the audio, the word ""option"" is missing.
GOP strategist Garren Shipley sent us an email for Hugo’s campaign, saying a ""Medicare-for-All option"" is equivalent to abolishing private insurance.
Let’s define the terms:
Medicare 
Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers Americans 65 or older and a few other groups with disabilities or specific diseases. In 2018, it provided health coverage for 59.9 million people, about 52 million them senior citizens.
Medicare for All
Medicare for All would replace the current health insurance system with a single, government-run program that would cover  all Americans. Employers would be barred from offering competing insurance.
Medicare for All is a signature issue in the presidential race of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. He’s proposed a generous plan that would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as vision and dental care. It would not subject consumers to any out-of-pocket costs, except a copay on prescriptions.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget has not estimated the cost of Sanders’ proposal or less-generous single-payer plans. The Mercatus Center, a libertarian research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates Sanders’ plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years and wouldn’t be paid for even if income and corporate taxes were doubled.
The Urban Institute, a more liberal-leaning academic center in Washington, looked at Sanders’ plan in 2016 and predicted it would add $32 trillion over the decade. The Institute estimated that state and local governments would save $4.1 trillion over 10 years, and that households and businesses would see about $21.9 trillion in savings.
Public option
Public option plans would give middle and upper-income working adults a choice: They could remain privately insured, or buy into a new government-run program that would use the network of Medicare providers and costs. 
There are at least four public options bills lingering in Congress, including one - called Medicare X -  cosponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. The CBO has not done cost analyses of the bills.  Supporters say Medicare X would at least break even because the bill requires that premiums ""cover the full actuarial cost of offering such a plan, including administrative costs."" A 2013 CBO study concluded a similar program would reduce federal deficits by $158 billion over 10 years.
Helmer’s record
Researching Helmer, we found eight instances where Helmer either said, or was reported to have said that he supported a Medicare-for-All  option. In contrast, we found only one instance where he more broadly stated Medicare-for-All (without option). That was in the print in the TV ad Hugo cites. And remember, at the same time those words appeared, Helmer was saying in the ad that he supported a public option.
In addition to Helmer’s spoken words in the commercial, we found three articles in The Washington Post , one by ABC News, and one in The McLean Connection saying Helmer supported a Medicare-for-All option.
Helmer wrote an op-ed in The Winchester Star pledging, ""I will fight to ensure every American has access to health care by supporting a Medicare-for-All option that allows any American who doesn’t have or doesn’t like their insurance to opt in to Medicare."" He made a nearly identical statement at a candidates forum.  
Ballotpedia wrote in 2018,"" On his campaign website, Helmer listed gun safety, expanding the Affordable Care Act to include a Medicare for All option, and job creation as some of his policy priorities.""
Hugo’s Justification
How does Hugo turn Helmer’s repeated calls for health insurance options into a call for ending private medical insurance? By making a very literal argument.
Shipley said there’s no such thing as a Medicare-for-All option - it’s a contradiction in terms. He said Medicare for All inherently means there’s a single insurance provider - the government - and there can be no option.
Shipley noted that ""public option"" is the correct term for offering a choice between private or government-run health insurance, and Helmer never used those words.
""If Helmer supported a public option plan, he would have said he supported a public option, or ‘Medicare X,’ as proposed by Tim Kaine,"" Shipley said. ""But he didn’t. He said ‘Medicare for All.’""
Our ruling
Hugo says Helmer wants to abolish private health insurance.
Helmer repeatedly said in a 2018 campaign that he supports a ""Medicare-for -All option"" that ""allows Americans who doesn’t have or doesn’t like his insurance to opt into Medicare."" In other words, private insurance would continue to exist.
But Helmer used imprecise language that Hugo exploits with a semantic argument. Since Medicare for All means the government would be the sole health insurance provider, Hugo says it can’t have a private insurance option. Ergo, Helmer wants to end private insurance, according to Hugo’s campaign.
Had Helmer used the proper term - public option - Hugo’s logic would have evaporated. But his poor phrasing left him open to interpretation, and Hugo has taken the liberty to misleadingly create a position for Helmer.
We rate Hugo’s statement Mostly False."
7,"""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA""","on Tuesday, September 17th, 2019",http://politifact.com/missouri/statements/2019/sep/17/roy-blunt/report-backs-blunt-claim-2-billion-increase-trade-/,True,Roy Blunt,"Report backs Blunt claim of $2 billion increase for trade deal with Mexico, Canada | PolitiFact Missour","Congress reconvened in September to deliberate the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada.


The trade agreement, known as USMCA, has been a hot topic among farmers and politicians over the past year.


In an Aug. 13 Facebook post, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt endorsed the agreement: ""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA. This trade deal is a win for America’s farmers, ranchers, and businesses.""


A spokesperson for Blunt said the number came from a report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which says the agreement would increase ""exports by $2.2 billion (1.1 percent) when fully implemented.""


Billions sounds like a lot. The 1.1%, not so much. We decided to look into this claim.


So, what exactly is the agreement?


The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a trade deal that would replace NAFTA. Mexico ratified the new agreement in June. In Canada, Parliament introduced the bill in May but has insisted on going through the ratification process in tandem with the U.S.


The trick is this: The window for Canada’s ratification is getting smaller, as its federal election is Oct. 21. If the U.S. Congress does not move quickly enough and Canada doesn’t ratify before Sept. 15, it will have to reintroduce the agreement to the next Parliament.


Meanwhile, House Democrats control the agreement’s fate in Congress.


Some call the new deal NAFTA 2.0. One of the big changes to agriculture is dairy. Under the agreement, Canada would increase quotas on dairy and remove restrictions on cheese, said Jonathan Doh, professor at Villanova University School of Business.


But there weren't any other major changes in the agriculture portion from the original NAFTA, according to Pat Westhoff, Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute director. The deal, if passed, would take effect early 2020.

How does it affect Missouri farmers?

Missouri exports its agriculture all across the world, but the state’s top partners are Canada and Mexico.


In 2017, Missouri’s top agriculture exports were corn and soybeans. Missouri corn ranked No. 6 and soybeans No. 8 in the U.S. in exports, according to state data from the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. Dairy is not listed in the state’s top agricultural exports.


""It’s important to Missouri to have a strong trade agreement with those countries because about two-thirds of our exports from Missouri go to those two countries,"" said Eric Bohl, Missouri Farm Bureau director of public affairs and advocacy. ""Canada is our No. 1 export partner. Mexico is our No. 2 export partner.""


Although Doh said the increase was significant, Westhoff said that the 1.1% projected increase is very marginal, in part because dairy is the only agriculture product with a major change. The United States International Trade Commission does not break down the numbers by state.


Our ruling


Blunt said in a Facebook post, ""U.S. agricultural & food exports are expected to increase more than $2 billion annually under #USMCA.""


The consensus is that the USMCA could increase trade exports by $2.2 billion annually, but that tells only part of the story. The increase is just 1.1% nationally, and probably less for Missouri because the state produces so little dairy.


Still, this claim is correct, so we rate this statement True."

The tweet was later shared by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts who’s running for president. She has 3.2 million followers.
""What happened today is beyond unacceptable. Calling a surprise vote on the budget — at the same time that many members were at 9/11 memorial services —is flat-out wrong,"" NC Rep. Chaz Beasley, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, tweeted. Beasley paraphrased reporting by WTVD.
The Washington Post tweeted a misleading headline, too: ""North Carolina Republicans overrode a budget veto while Democrats were at a 9/11 ceremony.""
While the News & Observer’s story and headline — NC House overrides budget veto in surprise vote with almost half of lawmakers absent — were accurate, the Raleigh-based newspaper posted a partly erroneous caption on Instagram: ""Most Democrats were absent for 9/11 ceremonies and were told there would be no vote during the morning session.""
But these claims about the budget vote on Sept. 11 all get one thing wrong: Most Democrats weren’t at a 9/11 memorial service.
PolitiFact NC, which has had a reporter covering the story since the Sept. 11 vote, found only one House Democrat who said he was at a 9/11 event. That Democrat is Rep. Garland Pierce, who said he attended a 9/11 memorial event in Raeford.
No other Democrat has come forward — not after Speaker Moore slammed what he called ""fake news,"" and not after PolitiFact NC reached out to Rep. Darren Jackson, the House minority leader, to ask if other Democrats attended a 9/11 event.
Schedule confusion
Most Democrats skipped the Sept. 11 morning session because they believed it would be a non-voting session, Jackson said in a press conference last week.
The budget was on the House calendar. But Jackson says Rep. David Lewis of Harnett County, a top Republican, told him there’d be no votes that morning.
Lewis denies Jackson’s claim. He has acknowledged texting a WRAL reporter to tell her he thought there would be no votes during the Wednesday morning session. But Lewis claims he didn’t relay that prediction to legislators.
Some corrections made
Beasley, a Mecklenburg County Democrat who’s running for lieutenant governor, later corrected his claim.
""One correction: at least one member, Garland Pierce, was attending a 9/11 memorial service, as was the Governor. The article originally noted that some members were, but it has since been updated. I hate that this budget fight has distracted from the true focus of 9/11,"" he tweeted later, sharing the WTVD story that had been updated.
The N&O corrected its Instagram post. The Washington Post also tweeted a clarification: ""An earlier version of this article overly generalized the reason for Democrats’ absence from the General Assembly session. The story has been updated.""
But some tweets and stories remain inaccurate. As of Tuesday morning, the NowThis tweet had been shared more than 700 times and got 1,600 ""likes.""
Our ruling
Various media outlets said NC Democratic legislators were at a 9/11 memorial service when Republicans held a controversial budget vote. PolitiFact is aware of only one Democrat besides Gov. Cooper who claimed to be at a 9/11 event. We rate this claim False.

It’s a table that purports to show the charities that are ""the good guys,"" and those that play people for suckers, paying lavish salaries to their CEOs and spending a puny percentage to actually help people.
Among its key claims for good charities, it says the head of the Salvation Army makes only $13,000 a year, and the chief of Ronald McDonald Houses is paid nothing at all. 
Among the credited purported bad guys, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, better known as UNICEF, gets bad marks for paying its CEO $1.2 million, spending 14% of its money on programs, and giving its CEO a Rolls Royce to use. The March of Dimes is second on the list, paying its CEO $450,000 and putting just 10% into programs.
This post, which was published on Facebook on Sept. 6, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Here’s the graphic:

This table appeared in 2015, and some of its numbers might have been more accurate then. But fast-forward to 2019 and, by and large, the charities it warns about make much better use of their charitable donations today than the chart suggests. And most of them don’t pay their CEOs as much as this claims.
We focused on the organizations that were labeled as bad places for donations, as well as the claims of uncompensated CEOs. Let’s take those claims one by one.
Salvation Army: CEO pay of $13,000
According to the post, the head of the Christian charity Salvation Army drew only $13,000 in annual compensation. It’s not clear whether this is supposed to refer to the international leader of the London-based organization, whose title is general of the Salvation Army, or the top executive of the U.S. branch. Either way, that figure looks to be off by a wide margin.
The U.S. branch’s 2018 report identified the current top executive — known as the ""national commander"" — as David Hudson. The annual report did not disclose his salary. But a Better Business Bureau review of the charity from August 2018 said Hudson’s predecessor, David Jeffrey, earned an annual salary of $140,201 — well above what the post claimed.
For tax purposes, the Salvation Army is akin to a church, and thus does not have to file a Form 990, the financial disclosure form that nonprofit organizations file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. We did not hear back when we reached out to the charity to ask about executive compensation.  
As a percent of its total expenses, the Salvation Army spends 82% on charitable services, according to a 2017 Forbes profile of the organization. The social media post placed that percent higher, at 93%.
Ronald McDonald Houses: CEO pay of zero
The viral post is correct: The president and CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities, Sheila Musolino, is uncompensated, according to its latest federal filing.
The viral post’s depiction of the charity is a hair too high. It claims that $0.90 of every dollar spent goes towards helping the families of sick children. The organization’s 2017 annual report claims $0.87. A 2018 review by the group Charity Navigator puts the number closer to $0.86.
UNICEF: CEO pay of $1.2 million, use of Rolls Royce, 14% in aid
This part of the claim is completely wrong: In 2017, UNICEF USA, the American branch of the global organization overseen by the United Nations, paid its president Caryl Stern $582,961, not $1.2 million as the meme claims. Even after adding in the value of other compensation, Stern makes $665,879, a bit over half of the number in the table.
As for the amount that gets spent on actual programs, of the $598 million it raised in 2018, it spent over $490 million on programs. That’s 82%, or about six times higher than the 14% figure in the meme. Charity Navigator gave it a financial rating of 77.5.
And about that Rolls Royce Stern allegedly has at her use? That’s a myth, debunked by Snopes two years ago.
March of Dimes: CEO pay of $495,000, 10% in aid
A mixed bag: The post undershoots on the CEO pay and is off by a factor of seven on the program side.
The March of Dimes is all about making sure babies are born healthy. Out of its roughly $150 million yearly budget, it makes grants, supports research centers and produces a lot of educational materials for expecting mothers.
According to its latest 990 filing, it paid its president Stacey Stewart a total of $534,000 in 2017. The viral post listed CEO pay at $495,000.
But the post also said the March of Dimes only spent 10% on programming. The real number is at least 74% of contributions, based on the 990 filing. Charity Navigator gives it a financial rating of 62.14, and reports that 75% of all expenses went toward programs.
United Way: CEO pay of $1.026 million, 9% in aid
The Facebook post falsely claims that the charitable organization United Way dedicates only 9% of its expenses to the needy. That’s far from the truth.
Based on the organization’s 2017 annual report, the most conservative reading shows 79% of expenses went toward helping people.
Forbes, put the figure around 86%, based on 2018 financial data. A Charity Navigator report from May 2019 rates the organization’s efficiency even higher, finding the charity sent nearly 94% percent of its total expenses to delivering programs and services. 
As for executive compensation, the viral list’s figure of $1.02 million lowballed the CEO’s actual salary. According to United Way, CEO Brian Gallagher made $1.66 million in 2017. 
American Red Cross: CEO pay of $1.03 million, 8% in aid
The humanitarian relief charity is more efficient than the post gives it credit for, but how much more is unclear, because of the way the Red Cross reports on its operations.
The Red Cross has come under fire in recent years for its claims about how much of its expenses go toward charity. As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, ProPublica and NPR in 2014 reported that the Red Cross repeatedly misled the public when it said 91% of every donated dollar went to provide services.
The hitch is, the Red Cross collects and sells a lot of blood. That has a large and positive impact on the organization’s bottom line. No one argues it’s a needed service, but it isn’t the same as the disaster relief for which the Red Cross is equally well known.
The NPR-ProPublica investigation found that fundraising absorbed, on average, 17% of every donated dollar. That alone would deliver an efficiency of 83%, but the investigation said that was too high because the 83% included an unknown amount of administrative overhead. 
The viral graphic also inflated the salary of American Red Cross CEO Gail J. McGovern. The viral post claimed the top exec drew a $1.03 million annual salary. In fact, the organization’s most recent public disclosure form shows McGovern made around $686,000.
Goodwill Industries: CEO pay of $2.3 million, 8% in aid
Goodwill Industries is purportedly tied for last on the viral list, in terms of efficiency. The graphic claims falsely that the organization steers only 8% of its expenses toward charitable programs. But that’s completely bogus. 
According to a Forbes review, the charity — known for its thrift stores — dedicates 89% of its spending on programs to help people overcome barriers to employment, and other related services.
Its most recent 990 listed former CEO Jim Gibbons’ earnings around $717,000 in 2017 — not $2.3 million, as the post claimed. 
A final note: Not even the man who posted this vouched for it. He wrote, ""I can not speak to the veracity of this document, but since it comes at a time where the information is needed, I decided to post it.""
Give the man points for candor, but as a rule, if you don’t know that something is accurate, don’t share it.
Our ruling
A recent Facebook post recirculated an outdated table that divided well-known charities into those that spent donations wisely and those that did not. Most of the numbers in the table were not just wrong, they were wildly wrong. The data inflated CEO salaries and lowballed the share of money going to charitable programs by factors ranging from two to 10.
In a couple of cases, the numbers were correct or nearly correct, but those were the rare exceptions.
We rate this Mostly False."
7,"""We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""","on Tuesday, September 17th, 2019",http://politifact.com/health-check/statements/2019/sep/17/christy-harrison/obesity-stigma-and-yo-yo-dieting-not-bmi-behind-ch/,Mostly False,Christy Harrison,"Obesity stigma and yo-yo dieting, not BMI,  are behind chronic health conditions, dietitian claims | PolitiFact Health Check","In a recent New York Times opinion column, dietitian Christy Harrison, an ""intuitive eating coach"" and author, responded to a fellow clinician who had questioned some of her thoughts on the link between being overweight and developing other medical conditions.
Harrison noted that although most health professionals have been taught that higher body mass index (BMI) causes poor health outcomes, she wrote, ""unfortunately, that just isn’t true.""
She added: ""We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""
We decided to investigate the point she was making, which is at the center of a larger, often-heated debate about whether it is possible to be overweight and healthy at the same time — a perspective advocated by the ""Health at Every Size"" movement, of which Harrison is a part. With nearly 72% of U.S. adults considered overweight or obese, this is a pressing issue.
When we reached out to Harrison to find out the basis of her statement, she responded quickly, citing two papers as her main sources.
The first, a 2011 piece published in the Nutrition Journal, argues it might be better to shift away from weight-loss efforts to improving health in other ways that are weight-neutral.
Its lead author, Linda Bacon, a professor at the University of California-Davis, wrote ""Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,"" a 2010 book embraced by ""fat acceptance"" advocates.
It addresses Harrison’s first point with this: ""While it is well established that obesity is associated with increased risk for many diseases, causation is less well-established.""
The other paper, a 2014 piece in the Journal of Obesity, makes similar arguments.
Causation, correlation, association: Let’s unpack that
There is an old saw used by most statisticians: Correlation does not equal causation.
But what does that mean? Let’s use a fake example: Some people have trouble seeing at night. Turns out all those people ate carrots. Ergo, there could be a correlation between people who ate carrots and those who experienced night vision problems.
That doesn't prove anything else, though, such as causation. Correlation is necessary when trying to determine causation, but doesn’t prove it.  
""Epidemiological studies never show causation, only association,"" said Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
To establish cause, epidemiologists need more evidence. 
The best way, considered the ""gold standard,"" is to randomly assign people to one group or another ― feeding one group carrots and withholding carrots from the other. Researchers would then monitor any difference in how many people develop night vision problems.
That’s nifty, but not always possible or ethical. One could not, for example, randomly assign some people to a group and then cause them to become overweight.  
Instead, researchers use different types of studies, such as those that compare groups of people who already have the characteristic — say, carrot eating or being overweight — with those who don’t to see if patterns emerge.
They use methods to control for things that might affect the results, such as age, gender, income level, whether a person smokes and other factors. Then they can estimate how strong of an association or correlation they see.
With smoking and lung cancer, very strong associations were seen, leading to the conclusion that, yes, smoking causes lung cancer. But does excess weight cause other health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sleep apnea or joint problems?
""With the case of weight, the associations are much weaker,"" said Kendrin Sonneville, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
So on this point, Henderson’s statement holds up. Current scientific research supports a correlation between being overweight and suffering poor health outcomes, but it does not definitively establish causation.
But others, especially clinicians, say there is little doubt that being overweight strongly raises the risk of developing such health problems.
""This isn’t up for debate,"" said Dr. Harold Bays, chief science officer for the Obesity Medicine Association, which represents practitioners who treat overweight patients.
""The overwhelming amount of clinical and scientific data supports obesity as a disease, both as a direct and indirect contributor to a large number of adverse metabolic and other health consequences,"" he said.
A 2018 Endocrine Society scientific statement, for example, looked across many studies of overweight and obesity, concluding that the two contribute to ""type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, and hepatobiliary disease, among others.""
Then things get murky.
Bays and the other experts agreed that some people who are overweight might not develop other conditions.
""It is absolutely true that not all cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and fatty liver are due to obesity,"" said Bays.
They acknowledged that people who fall into the category of being obese or overweight may even appear healthy metabolically — at least for a while.
But there’s also a caution.
""If you say, ‘Wait a minute, is their blood sugar where we want it … aren’t their triglycerides a little high and what about their blood pressure?’ And that’s not even to mention pain to the joints or sleep apnea,"" Bays said. ""When you drill down, very few people would truly meet the criteria of being metabolically healthy but obese, and if you follow them for five or 10 years, now the majority are going to have something.""
What about stigma?
There’s been less research around Harrison’s second point: that most, if not all, of the diseases associated with being obese or overweight are caused instead by the stigma heavy people face, or the yo-yo effect of dieting, losing weight and then gaining it back again, in regular cycles.
She pointed to research included in the paper by Bacon reporting that weight cycling could lead to hypertension, or high blood pressure. The research, however, found associations though not specific causation.
Similarly, in another study Harrison provided, people who reported weight discrimination ― 6% of the sample studied — had twice the risk of physiological stress over nearly 10 years. Such stress can be associated with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the study said.
But most of those we spoke with strongly disputed the sweeping statement that so many chronic conditions can be caused by stigma and weight cycling.
While those two things can factor into health problems, they are not responsible for most of the health outcomes seen by her patients, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
Stanford also takes issue with advocates who promote the idea that being overweight isn’t a big health risk factor.
""The Health at Every Size movement goes against what we know about obesity as a disease,"" Stanford said. ""Their aim in that movement is to not learn the science.""
Our ruling
Harrison said the notion that a higher BMI causes poor health outcomes ""just isn’t true"" ― adding that ""we have a host of issues associated with high BMIs. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""
On a strict reading of the science, she has a point. It is very difficult to prove definitively what causes disease, and showing ""correlation"" is a different finding than causation. However, she appears to apply this standard selectively, using it both to undermine the relationship between high BMI and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions. 
But in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies nationally and worldwide have shown definite links between being overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is far less evidence for the role that weight stigma and yo-yo dieting has in the development of those medical problems, although the experts urge continuing research into those questions.
We rate Harrison’s statement as Mostly False."
7,"Says instead of arresting a teen who was sneaking into a gym, a Chicago cop ""shot him 53 times.""","on Monday, September 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/16/facebook-posts/chicago-cop-didnt-shoot-teen-sneaking-gym-he-bough/,Pants on Fire!,Facebook posts,A Chicago cop didn’t shoot a teen for sneaking into a gym – he bought him a membership | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"A Facebook post that claims a Chicago police officer shot a teenager ""53 times"" for sneaking into a gym is a malicious distortion of what actually happened.
In reality, the police officer helped the teen buy a gym membership.
The Facebook post, which displays a photograph of the officer and his full name, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The real story originated in August 2017, according to the Chicago Tribune, when a teen around 15 years old was warned that if he continued to sneak onto the basketball court of the XSport Fitness facility in Skokie, Ill., just north of Chicago, the police would be called. The gym’s staff eventually alerted the Skokie Police Department after the boy attempted to get in again.
Valenti responded, and when he found out the teen had a membership that expired after his mother couldn’t afford it anymore, ""he offered to pay $150 out of his own pocket, asking fitness center workers how much membership time that would buy for the boy,"" the Tribune reported. 
It covered up to about four months, but after the gym’s corporate office found out about the situation, they said the $150 would go toward a two-year membership, instead, with the gym picking up the rest of the cost.
The false Facebook post includes Valenti’s full name and photo and appears to be the same photo published by the Tribune. In the post’s caption, it’s obvious the original text was erased and the part that says he ""shot him 53 times"" was inserted, as the text size and style doesn’t visually match up with the rest of the sentence.

8,"The United States is ""very energy independent.""","on Friday, September 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/13/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-us-energy-independence/,Half-True,Donald Trump,Donald Trump exaggerates US energy independence,"President Donald Trump, eager to make good on a campaign promise to end the United States’ reliance on foreign energy, claimed a premature victory.
""We are ending decades of foreign energy reliance to unleash the blessings of American energy independence,"" Trump said Sept. 12 at a dinner with the House Republican Conference in Baltimore. 
Moments later, Trump declared: ""We are very energy independent.""
While it’s not accurate to say the United States has already kicked its reliance on foreign sources of energy, the country is moving in this direction.
Production versus consumption
The White House did not define energy independence when we asked. So we'll go with the generally agreed upon definition: producing as much energy as is consumed domestically.
Several recent months have seen U.S. energy production outstrip consumption — which supports Trump’s claim. But overall, the data cuts against the notion that the United States is ""very energy independent.""
In the first five months of 2019, the United States used more energy than it produced. Specifically, the country produced 41.5 quadrillion British thermal units of energy, but consumed 42.1 quadrillion BTUs, according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration. 
Some individual months have seen the United States achieve ""energy independence,"" in the sense of producing more energy than Americans consumed. Two months in fall 2018 did so, and the United States produced more than it consumed in April and May of this year.
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
The United States has been a net energy importer since 1953. But according to the Energy Information Administration, that’s likely to soon change. The EIA projects that with continued growth in American petroleum and natural gas exports, plus slow growth in U.S. energy consumption, the country is on track to become a net energy exporter by next year.
Data from the last decade points to the country trending in that direction too. The gap between U.S. energy production and consumption has been narrowing for some time, and achieved even greater parity during Trump's presidency.
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
That said, some experts argue it’s not in the United States’ best interest to be totally disengaged from the foreign energy market — for instance, when hurricanes in the Gulf threaten domestic sources. 
""Without energy imports, we could not run our system optimally,"" said Frank Verrastro, an energy and national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
Still, given Trump’s campaign promise to achieve energy independence, he’s eager to claim a victory — and his claim may be on ever sturdier ground as Election Day 2020 approaches. But to say the United States right now is ""very energy independent"" is a touchdown celebration before reaching the end zone.
Our ruling
Trump said the United States is ""very energy independent.""
It’s somewhat premature to label the United States energy independent given that Americans consumed more energy than the country produced for most of the last year that we have data. But the gap between U.S. energy production and consumption has been narrowing for some time, particularly during Trump’s presidency, and data shows several recent months where production outpaced American energy use.

The tweet is wrong: It’s not true that the Odessa shooting suspect had a sticker on his truck supporting O’Rourke. 
It’s a conspiracy theory, and one that was promoted by Trump campaign surrogate Anthony Shaffer, according to the Washington Post.
""Shaffer, who has promoted baseless claims about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and clashed with the U.S. military and intelligence communities over his allegations of an intelligence failure before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, took to Twitter after the shooting to assail Democrats for calling for new restrictions for firearms,"" the Post reported. ""In one post, he said the gunman was a supporter of O’Rourke, tagging the Democrat, and retweeting a post from an account with the handle @suemo54 and the name ‘Sue Moore.’""
That tweet was similar to the one that appeared on Facebook, and Shaffer stood by his own tweet, saying ""that’s not what I’ve seen from people"" when he was informed that his claim had no basis in fact, according to the story. 
The Twitter account that appears to have ""hatched the conspiracy theory about O’Rourke,"" the Post reported, ""identifies its owner as a 72-year-old retiree living in Mesa, Ariz."" 
A spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety told the newspaper there was no indication the suspected shooter was linked to O’Rourke.

8,"Says John Bolton ""fundamentally was a man of the left.""","on Friday, September 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/sep/13/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-falsely-claims-john-bolton-was-man-/,Pants on Fire!,Tucker Carlson,Tucker Carlson falsely claims John Bolton was ‘man of the left’ | Pund,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson celebrated the departure of former national security adviser John Bolton, saying the mustachioed war hawk was actually a lefty.
""If you’re wondering why so many progressives are mourning Bolton’s firing tonight, it’s because Bolton himself fundamentally was a man of the left,"" Carlson said Sept. 10 on his show.
Carlson said Bolton was ""one of the most progressive people in the Trump administration"" and alleged that he ""promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council.""
""There was not a human problem John Bolton wasn’t totally convinced could be solved with the brute force of government,"" Carlson said. ""That’s an assumption of the left, not the right.""
""Don’t let the moustache fool you,"" he added.
But it’s Carlson’s claims about the former national security adviser that are ridiculous. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.)
A lifelong conservative
First, a note about ideologies: In the United States, we tend to associate the terms ""left"" and ""right"" with the Democratic and the Republican Parties, respectively.
In that context, Carlson’s claim is ""nonsense,"" said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University, who previously served on staff for the Senate Democratic policy committee and the House Democratic caucus task force on Central America.
""Obviously it’s wrong if you’re defining it in terms of Democratic versus Republican politics,"" added Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, chief executive officer of Valens Global, a counter-terrorism consulting firm, and a former advisor for the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Community Partnerships under both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump.
""There’s no question that, based on the American political context, he would be considered a man of the right,"" Gartenstein-Ross said.
That’s because Bolton has spent his entire career in conservative circles and served in every GOP presidential administration going back to President Ronald Reagan, LeoGrande said.
Here are just a few examples of Bolton’s work prior to joining the Trump administration:
• In high school, Bolton volunteered to campaign for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who lost to President Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 general election.
• Bolton spent the 1972 summer between law school semesters interning for Vice President Spiro Agnew of President Richard Nixon’s administration.
• Bolton joined the Reagan administration in the Agency for International Development in 1981, serving a year as general counsel and a year in an administrative role. He later moved to Reagan’s Justice Department, where he was the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs from 1985 to 1988 and assistant attorney general for a year in 1988. 
• Bolton took over in 1989 as the State Department’s assistant secretary for international organization affairs under President George H.W. Bush. He held that post until 1993.
• Bolton served in 2005 as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, who appointed him on a ""recess appointment"" after the Republican-led Senate did not confirm his nomination.
• Bolton flirted with running for president in 2012 before endorsing Sen. Mitt Romney.
• Bolton worked for the conservative American Enterprise Institute and contributed to the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, for multiple years. He was also a contributor at Fox News, earning a salary of roughly $569,000 in 2017, per the Washington Post.
• Bolton created a super PAC in 2013 that contributed millions of dollars to Republican congressional candidates in 2014, 2016 and 2018. 
Foreign policy views
Best known for his foreign policy views, Bolton has criticized international institutions like the United Nations and called for a more aggressive stance toward hostile countries such as North Korea and Iran. He was an outspoken critic of Obama, penning op-eds, a number of tweets and a book about his policies.
But Bolton’s hawkishness — which Carlson described as a preference for ""the brute force of government"" — does not make him liberal, LeoGrande said. ""In the foreign policy field, Bolton’s speciality, the interventionists have been conservative Republicans.""
""From Central America in the 1980s to the Middle East today, conservatives have been the ones who think that the United States can get its abroad way by ‘brute force,’"" he said.
Here are some of Bolton’s recent statements about foreign policy:
• In a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Bolton argued in favor of preemptively striking North Korea: ""It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ‘necessity’ posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons by striking first.""
• In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton called for military action against Iran: ""Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure. The inconvenient truth is that only military action … can accomplish what is required.""
• In a 2015 interview with the Washington Examiner, Bolton said he still believes invading Iraq was the right move: ""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct.""
• In a 2017 Telegraph op-ed, Bolton said Russia’s interference in U.S. elections is ""a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.""
• In an address at the 2018 CPAC conservative conference, Bolton called for a ""massive military buildup"" and ""a comprehensive national debate on why preventing China from becoming the dominant world power"" should be a top concern for Americans.
• In a 2018 address, Bolton said Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua represent a ""troika of tyranny"" and announced new sanctions against Venezuela.
The National Security Council
We also found no evidence to support Carlson’s claim that Bolton ""promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council."" (The NSC did not respond to requests for comment.)
The Washington Post and Politico detailed the shuffling that occurred after Bolton took over as national security adviser. Many officials left their posts, while others were moved to new roles. Bolton left some openings vacant and filled others with people from outside of government.
For example, Bolton brought on Mauricio Claver-Carone, a political fundraiser and lobbyist, to replace a CIA officer as the NSC director for Latin America, according to the Washington Post. 
Similarly, he gave Richard Goldberg, an adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a key post focused on Iran. He had Charles Kupperman, a former defense industry executive who once worked for Reagan, appointed as deputy national security adviser.
But none of them were ""Obama loyalists,"" as far as we could tell.
On the contrary, LeoGrande said Claver-Carone ""denounced Obama’s opening to Cuba and has a long history of lobbying for the hardline foreign policy positions of the Cuban-American right.""
Plus, government bureaucracies like the NSC are often full of career government officials who stay on staff from one administration to the next, Gartenstein-Ross said.
""If someone has served in the Obama administration, that doesn’t mean they’re an Obama loyalist,"" he said. ""It’s very typical for career civil servants to serve across administrations.""
Our ruling
Carlson said Bolton ""fundamentally was a man of the left.""
Bolton spent his whole career in Republican politics, and experts said his views have always tilted more to the American right than left. 
We found no proof that he had elevated ""Obama loyalists,"" either.

8,"Says people convicted of felonies or under restraining orders ""can buy a firearm without going through a background check.""","on Friday, September 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/13/josh-kaul/buy-gun-wisconsin-after-felony-restraining-order/,True,Josh Kaul,Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order? | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Gun control is yet again — tragically — up for debate in Wisconsin.
After mass shootings at an El Paso Walmart and a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district left 31 dead, Wisconsin leaders have raised questions about ""loopholes"" in state law.
Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation in August 2019 that would require background checks for nearly all gun sales. Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, has threatened to call a special session on the matter if Republican legislative leaders don’t take up the bill.
This comes as 80% of state residents support universal background checks — including 75% of gun owners — according to a Marquette University Law School Poll conducted in mid-August.
So how is that different from what Wisconsin has now?
The state’s Democratic attorney general offered an example.
""Because we don’t have universal background checks, people who are a danger to others — including people who have been convicted of a dangerous felony or are subject to a domestic violence restraining order — currently can buy a firearm without going through a background check,"" Josh Kaul said in an Aug. 15, 2019, tweet.
State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day.
Can someone in those circumstances really purchase a gun without a background check?
Most gun buyers go through a background check
A convicted felon, or someone with an active restraining order connected to domestic violence, would not pass a criminal background check to qualify for a firearm purchase.
Such background checks are required under federal law for any purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearm Licenses dealer — which would include any retailers or others engaged in gun sales as a profession.
In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond.
This two-pronged system covers the ""vast majority"" of firearm purchases in the state, Kaul said in an Aug. 9, 2019, appearance on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now.""
This is the process gun rights advocates refer to when noting background checks already exist. 
But it’s not the only way to buy a gun.
Private sales treated differently
A 2015 study found 22% of gun owners bought their most recent firearm without going through a background check.
That’s because gun sales in Wisconsin between private parties (those without a federal firearms license) aren’t subject to reporting, waiting period or background check requirements.
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving dealers. And Wisconsin is one of 29 states that does not impose any state-level regulations either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization that seeks ""laws, policies, and programs proven to save lives from gun violence."" 
Websites such as Armslist — a Craigslist-style firearms marketplace — connect private sellers and are heavily used. A search in September 2019 showed more than 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin.

Two guns used in high-profile shootings here were purchased through Armslist by people under court orders not to possess guns.
In October 2012, Radcliffe Haughton killed three people including his estranged wife and injured four others, before killing himself at Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield. A day before the shooting he purchased a .40-caliber handgun in the parking lot of a Germantown McDonald’s after connecting with the seller on Armslist. Two days before that, a judge had issued a restraining order that barred Haughton from owning a gun.
In January 2018, Robert Schmidt bought a Glock 9 mm handgun from a 19-year-old man through Armslist, days after he was released from the Calumet County jail on a bond that prohibited him from having a gun. The transaction took place in a Walmart parking lot. Schmidt was charged at the time with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun to kill his wife and then himself at a home just outside Appleton.
Our ruling
Kaul said felons and people subject to domestic abuse restraining orders are currently able to buy guns in Wisconsin without going through a background check.
All purchases from firearms dealers are subject to state and federal requirements that include a criminal background check. But Kaul is right that Wisconsin is among the states with no oversight of gun sales between private parties.
That has allowed people in the circumstances he described to buy guns, in some cases with tragic results.
We rate this claim True."
8,"""Was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy.""","on Friday, September 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/health-check/statements/2019/sep/13/bernie-sanders/do-50-million-people-really-lose-health-coverage-e/,Mostly False,Bernie Sanders,Do 50 million people really lose health coverage each year because of their jobs? | PolitiFact Health Check,"The moderators kicked off the third Democratic debate with health care, teeing up another round of the ongoing ""Medicare for All"" debate. 
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders caught our attention by claiming that 50 million people lose their private insurance every year due to employment changes. 
""George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy,"" Sanders said.
That sounds like a huge number even before he qualified it by attributing it to job loss and other work-related occasions for an insurance lapse.
We reached out to the Sanders’ campaign to find out the basis for this claim, and they pointed to an analysis by the People’s Policy Project, a social democratic-leaning think-tank. That analysis hinges on a question asked as part of a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey in 2014, plus a little basic multiplication.
The survey asked adults between the ages of 18 and 64, in 43 states: ""In the PAST 12 MONTHS was there any time when you did NOT have ANY health insurance or coverage?"" In response, 12.9% said they had experienced a gap in coverage, while 11.5% said they had been uninsured for more than 12 months.
The think-tank analysis then combined those percentages and multiplied them by current population estimates, coming up with ""just under 50 million people"" who were uninsured for at least part of the year. (It went on to endorse ""Medicare for All."")
This claim becomes perplexing when you consider the total number of uninsured people in recent years. In 2013, there were more than 44 million uninsured, non-elderly Americans in total. With the initial implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that number steadily declined until last year when it ticked up slightly to 27.5 million. 
A Sanders spokeswoman also cited another People’s Policy Project blog post analyzing the number of people who leave their jobs (66.1 million in 2018, it said) and government data on the number of jobs the average worker has had by age 50 (11.9).
The campaign specifically pointed to this sentence in the blog post: ""This labor turnover data leaves little doubt that people with employer-sponsored insurance are losing that insurance constantly, as are their spouses and kids.""
The CDC data is compelling, to be sure — but Sanders did not accurately portray what it said on the debate stage, nor did he accurately portray the policy analysis his campaign claimed was his source.
Sanders appears to suggest that one-third of those with private insurance are uninsured for at least a short time every year because of a change to their employment benefits.
In actuality, the CDC data show that about 24.4% of non-elderly adults in 2014 had experienced at least a gap in insurance coverage in the previous year. The question did not ask respondents to specify the cause.
The age of the report also poses a challenge: The Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion began in 2014, and the report surveyed just 23 Medicaid expansion states at the time. Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, suggesting the number of people with insurance gaps on an annual basis could have dropped.
And the People’s Policy Project analysis actually refers broadly to 50 million non-elderly Americans who were uninsured, temporarily or otherwise -- it doesn’t say those people were uninsured because their job situation changed.
Our ruling
Sanders said that 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year ""when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy."" 
Sanders has a point that coverage continuity is a big problem in a country where roughly 150 million get their insurance from their jobs. But his claim inflates the scope of the problem]. 
He took a broad finding about the number of people who had experienced an insurance gap for any reason roughly five years ago and misleadingly used it to describe a much narrower segment of the current population who lost insurance because of employment changes. 
The claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False."
8,"Says the Obama administration ""didn't lock people up in cages.""","on Friday, September 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/13/joe-biden/fact-checking-biden-use-cages-during-obama-adminis/,False,Joe Biden,-checking Biden on use of cages for immigrants during Obama administration,"Joe Biden claimed that a key difference between the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump is that Obama didn’t ""lock people up in cages.""
During the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Univision anchor and debate co-moderator asked Biden why Latinos should trust him given the millions of deportations under Obama’s presidency, when Biden served as vice president.
""What Latinos should look at is, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one,"" Biden said. ""We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things, number one.""
We’ve noted that Obama did not have a policy to separate families arriving illegally at the border, and that separations under Trump happened systematically as a result of his administration’s policy to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally.
But Biden mentioned ""cages,"" specifically, and reporting from the time he was vice president described an enclosure for migrant children with that word.
Controversial use of ‘cages’ description
The term ""cages"" has continuously been used by Democrats in attacks against Trump and the detention of immigrants arriving at the border. The Trump administration says that the facilities it uses are not cages.
The description has been used to refer to chain-link enclosures holding immigrants at border processing facilities during both the Obama and Trump administrations. 
Notably, critics of Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy that resulted in family separations circulated a photo that purportedly showed children face down on the floor behind a chain-link enclosure during Trump’s tenure. However, the photo was from 2014 when Obama was president.
Our fact-check showed the Associated Press photo was taken in 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection facility in Nogales, Ariz. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article centered on an influx of children arriving at the border unaccompanied by a parent or guardian.
The Arizona Republic article, in part, said: 
""They are undocumented. They entered the country illegally. And when they were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they were shipped to Nogales from overwhelmed processing facilities in Texas.
""But they are still children in cages, not gangsters, not delinquents. Just children, 900 of them, in a makeshift border-town processing center that is larger than a football field.""
The article adds that the children are ""housed behind 18-foot-high chain-link fences topped with razor wire."" 
Additional description of the enclosure said: ""Nylon tarps, tied to the fences, provide a modicum of privacy between the groups. They share the kind of portable toilets used at fairs and construction sites, placed inside the cages and vented with clothes-dryer hoses.""
Reporting from the Los Angeles Times in 2014 referred to enclosures keeping immigrant children as ""makeshift cages.""
Here are other 2014 photos, from Getty Images, of children kept within chain-link enclosures. For comparison, here’s a 2018 photo provided by Customs and Border Protection, of immigrants in a similar chain-link enclosure.
Jeh Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary during the Obama administration, in media interviews and at other forums has been asked about the use of cages during the Obama administration.
During a June 2019 interview at an event by The Aspen Institute, Johnson was asked to speak about a photo that depicts him ""walking past what appears to be children in cages.""
""Very clearly, chain link, barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on Jan. 20, 2017, okay,"" Johnson said, adding that the photo was taken during a spike in the arrival of migrant children, and that under the law, children have to be transferred within 72 hours to the Health and Human Services department.
""But during that 72-hour period, when you have something that is a multiple, like four times, of what you’re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you’ve got to find places quickly to put kids. You can’t just dump 7-year-old kids on the streets of McAllen or El Paso. And so these facilities were erected, that one I think was a large warehouse, and they put those chain-link partitions up so you could segregate young women from young men from, you know, kids from adults, until they are either released or transferred to HHS. Is it ideal? Of course not.""
Johnson addressed the photo from 2014 again the next month on CBS’ Face the Nation.
Johnson said in part, ""the partitions you see, some call them cages, are meant to separate the women from the men, the girls from the boys. But these were temporary.""
Our ruling
Biden said the Obama administration ""didn't lock people up in cages.""
Immigration policies of Obama and Trump are very different. Trump’s administration implemented a policy that led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. Obama did not have that policy.
But for Biden to say that Obama’s administration did not put people in cages is inaccurate. Obama and Biden in 2014 saw an influx of children arriving at the border without a parent or guardian, and reporting from 2014 by the Arizona Republic referred to a chain-link enclosure holding children as ""cages."" A former Homeland Security secretary under the Obama administration in interviews has acknowledged that some have described as ""cages"" the enclosures used during Obama’s tenure.
There’s a debate on whether a chain-link enclosure is a ""cage"" and whether applying that term to those structures is subjective. But the term certainly was used in 2014 to describe enclosures used by Obama’ administration.
We rate Biden’s claim False."
8,"""54 senators said, let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster.""","on Friday, September 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/13/elizabeth-warren/sen-elizabeth-warren-conflated-votes-assault-weapo/,Half-True,Elizabeth Warren,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren conflated votes on assault weapons, background checks","Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that while the majority of Americans want tighter gun control laws related to registration or banning assault weapons, that doesn’t happen because Congress is beholden to the gun industry.
""And unless we're willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster we're not going to get anything done on guns,"" Warren said during the Democratic debate in Houston. ""I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster.""
Not all of those points are accurate. Her campaign staff told us Warren meant to refer only to background checks. Fewer than 50 senators supported banning assault weapons.
Gun legislation votes following Sandy Hook
In April 2013, a few months after the Sandy Hook shooting, lawmakers took up votes on multiple gun control measures. All of them failed.
Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, teamed up with Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey on the legislation, which came to be known as the Manchin-Toomey amendment. 
The amendment called for expanding the checks to gun shows and internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. It was seen as a compromise to replace a stricter measure from Majority Leader Harry Reid.
The compromise amendment still fell short in a mostly partisan vote, when it was defeated 54-46. Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass.
On the same day, an assault weapons ban measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., failed when it received 40 votes. Fifteen members of her own Democratic Party (plus one independent) voted against the ban.
At the time, Democrats held 53 seats in the Senate, two independents caucused with the Democrats, and 45 senators were Republicans.
A spokeswoman for Warren said that her reference to 54 votes was for that Manchin-Toomey amendment.
In a Medium essay in August, Warren wrote that the Senate voted down an assault weapons ban and ""rejected a background checks proposal, even though 54 Senators from both parties voted for it, because of a right-wing-filibuster. These were the bare minimum steps we needed to take. And six years later, Congress still hasn’t done a thing.""
Our ruling
Warren said ""54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster.""
Warren was referring to votes on gun control legislation on April 17, 2013. A background check amendment failed when 54 senators voted for it, falling short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster threat. However, the vote to ban assault weapons failed with only 40 votes.

Castro accused Biden of changing his position in short order about the contours of his health care plan. ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?"" Castro asked Biden — a line that drew criticism from some commentators for suggesting that Biden, at 76, is having memory problems.
A look at the exchange and at Biden’s health care plan suggest that Castro is exaggerating any differences between Biden’s plan and his own, and is misleadingly interpreting what Biden said during the debate.
Let’s first look at Castro’s attack and Biden’s parries of his criticism:
CASTRO: ""The problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. … The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. That’s a big difference. Because Barack Obama’s vision was not to leave 10 million uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.""
BIDEN: ""They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in."" 
CASTRO: ""You just said that! You just said that two minutes ago!"" 
BIDEN: ""No."" 
CASTRO: ""You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in!"" 
BIDEN: ""I said if they cannot afford it!""
CASTRO: ""You said they would have to buy in!"" 
BIDEN: ""They would not have to buy in. If you qualified for Medicaid, they would automatically be enrolled."" 
CASTRO: ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago? I mean, I can’t believe you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you’re saying you don’t have to buy in. You’re forgetting that!""
BIDEN: ""I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money, you’re automatically enrolled.""
CASTRO: ""It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.""  
BIDEN: ""That'll be a surprise to him.""  
Castro’s criticism falls into two categories. We’ll look at them both.
Does Biden’s plan require people who want the public option to ""opt in""?
Biden does require those who want Medicare coverage to ""opt in,"" but this requirement is not nearly as significant as Castro makes it seem.
As described on his campaign website, Biden’s health care plan advocates ""giving Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option like Medicare. If your insurance company isn’t doing right by you, you should have another, better choice. Whether you’re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare.""
Biden’s plan would ""ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He’ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions, such as public schools, or other programs for low-income populations, such as SNAP,"" or food stamps.
This tracks with what Biden said at one point in the debate — that ""anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.""
On the surface, this is a difference with Castro’s plan. Castro’s proposal would ""strengthen Medicare for those who have it, and expand it to achieve universal healthcare coverage by including all Americans within the program."" Castro would ""allow individuals to obtain supplementary private insurance or opt out of Medicare if they have a high-standard private insurance plan through an employer or organization that is regulated under the Affordable Care Act.""
But Castro’s opt-out plan and Biden’s opt-in plan don’t seem significantly different.
Castro makes it sound like Biden’s opting-in process would be a noteworthy barrier. More likely, it would amount to a formality. Anyone who wanted the public option would have to request it and, presumably, sign forms like every other person seeking health insurance. But the important part is that they could not be rejected after they fill out those forms. 
The distinction between filling out the paperwork to become part of the public option (as Biden would have it) and automatically becoming enrolled unless you actively reject it (which would, at some point, also require different paperwork) does not strike us as the ""big difference"" Castro touted.
Did Biden contradict himself?
Castro’s second line of attack was that Biden initially said people would have to opt in to Medicare and then later changed his tune and said they wouldn’t have to opt in.
Biden did say at several points before Castro challenged him that enrollment would be automatic — essentially a formality.
Biden said that ""anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have."" 
He also said, ""If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance — from your employer — you automatically can buy into this. No pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.""
And Biden also said, ""Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.""
These are consistent with Biden’s response to Castro’s attack, that Americans who need the Medicare option would ""automatically be enrolled.""
Our ruling
Castro said, ""The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in (to a Medicare public option), and I would not require them to opt in. … They would automatically be enrolled. That’s a big difference."" He also suggested Biden was contradicting what he’d said moments before.
Castro’s plan is an opt-out plan while Biden’s is an opt-in plan, but the differences between those are much less than Castro suggests. Biden’s plan would guarantee Americans who are in need access to Medicare coverage, just like Castro’s would. The differences would likely amount to the nature or timing of paperwork, rather than being significant barriers to access.
Castro used this questionable distinction to charge that Biden had said opposing things within two minutes, but that’s an exaggeration at best.

""Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street — period,"" Biden said during the Democratic presidential debate in Houston Sept. 12.
Biden was responding to a moderator’s question about his failure to get an expanded background check bill passed after the Sandy Hook school mass shooting in 2012. 
The recent polls we found showed that a majority of Americans support banning assault weapons, but by a much smaller margin than Biden cited.
A 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. The ban expired in 2004. Efforts to renew the ban have been unsuccessful, but Biden has vowed to champion a ban.
Recent polls show majority support for banning assault weapons
We looked at the results of five polls taken after the early August mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. We limited our search to that time period because the question by debate moderator David Muir mentioned the El Paso shooting.
Overall, polls showed between 56% and 70% of people back a ban on assault rifles. Polls showed higher support among Democrats.
Politico/Morning Consult poll: Nearly 70% of all voters would back a ban on assault rifles. (In a New York Times op-ed in August, Biden cited that statistic.) More than 91 percent supported requiring background checks for all gun sales.
Fox News poll: 67% supported banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. The poll found 90% support for background checks on all gun buyers including at shows and private sales.
NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll: 57% said Congress should pass a ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault guns such as the AK-47 or the AR-15. The poll found 83% support for requiring background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales
Washington Post/ABC News poll: 56% support a ban on the sale of assault weapons. 89% support requiring background checks for all potential gun buyers.
HuffPost/YouGov poll: 59% favor an assault weapons ban and 81% favored background checks.
We asked the Biden campaign for his evidence and did not hear back immediately. We wondered whether Biden was referring to the percentage of Americans who support expanding background checks, which was in the ballpark of 90% in many polls.
Our ruling
Biden said ""over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street ⁠— period.""
We looked at five polls following the El Paso and Dayton shootings in early August. Those polls showed overall support for banning assault weapons ranged from 56% to 70%.

8,"Says aquatic life near Alaska, Canada and Australia have been found with cancer and mutations as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.","on Wednesday, September 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/11/facebook-posts/viral-post-claims-fish-alaska-are-getting-cancer-b/,Mostly False,Facebook posts,A viral post claims fish in Alaska are getting cancer because of Fukushima. They aren't | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"A widely shared Facebook post is trying to connect the Japanese nuclear disaster to an increase in cancer among marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia. The post, which was published Sept. 8, displays three photos of sharks and fish with apparent tumors or lesions on their skin. 
""Sharks are being found with massive cancerous tumors on their bodies. Salmon caught off the coast of Alaska are riddled with cancer,"" the post reads. ""Fukushima has been seeping radioactivity into our oceans daily since 2011, and the oceans are extremely sick because of it."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it’s been shared nearly 2,000 times, so we wanted to check it out.
The Fukushima nuclear disaster came after a tsunami hit the eastern coast of Japan in 2011, killing more than 18,000 people. The accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant between Tokyo and Sendai and resulted in the meltdown of three reactors. It was the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine.
While sharks and fish are capable of getting cancerous tumors, the photos in the post are misleading. None have been directly linked to Fukushima, and there’s little evidence to suggest that fish far from Japan have been affected by the disaster.
Photos don’t prove nuclear connection
We did reverse image searches for each of the photos included in the Facebook post. The first image, which shows a shark with what appear to be tumors around its mouth, dates back to at least 2013. That’s when a website called Live Science published it as part of a story about why sharks get cancer.
""It's unknown what caused the tumors in the great white or bronzer shark,"" Live Science wrote of the photo. ""However, reports of cancerous tumors in marine animals, especially mammals, have steadily increased over the past 20 years, raising concerns that industrial pollutants or human activities may trigger the cancers.""
The story — which was based on a 2013 study — doesn’t mention Fukushima specifically or nuclear disasters more broadly as having an effect.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
The second photo, which shows a fish with a lesion on its skin, is at least seven years old. We found it in a story published by the website ZME Science in November 2012, which covered how Canadian researchers had found contaminants near oil sands operations. 
The third image included in the Facebook post is a little more ambiguous. A search for it using TinEye, a tool that searches the internet for images, surfaced a 2012 Al Jazeera story about the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It reported that the image shows a shrimp with mutations as a result of the spill.
None of the stories mentioned nuclear radioactivity as having contributed to the lesions.
There’s little risk of tainted fish outside Japan
The Facebook post took three photos out of context. But does it have a larger point about the effect of Fukushima on fish?
Generally, no, but the answer is a little more complicated.
The post specifically mentions salmon off the coast of Alaska as being ""riddled with cancer."" But a public statement from the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation rebuts that, saying testing results have not indicated measurable levels of Fukushima-related radionuclides — radioactive atoms — in Alaskan seafood.
""(The Food and Drug Administration) has found no evidence that radionuclides of health concern from the Japanese nuclear power plant disaster are present in the U.S. food supply,"" the statement reads.
Some scientists have found salmon with trace amounts of cesium 134 — a radioactive element specifically associated with the Fukushima disaster — in Canadian waters. But the levels were 10,000 times lower than health safety guidelines.
As for the Great Barrier Reef, another area specifically mentioned in the post, the link between Fukushima and fish is just as weak. In a public statement published by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, officials said they hadn’t detected any substantial radioactivity off the coast.
""Ongoing monitoring programs are in place that continue to monitor for the Fukushima signature, but it is expected that by the time it reaches Australian waters, the radioactive material will have been diluted to such low levels that it will be undetectable,"" the statement reads.

In this Aug. 26, 2013 photo, fisherman Fumio Suzuki sorts out fish he caught aboard his boat Ebisu Maru in the waters off Iwaki, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, Japan. (AP)
Japan is a different story. 
A 2012 study found elevated levels of cesium in fish directly off the coast of Fukushima, and the government banned the sale of certain species of sea life that surpassed 100 becquerels per kilogram. Those bans slowly tapered off until February of this year, when officials noticed a spike in cesium-tainted fish off the Fukushima coast. But since the disaster, the government has implemented a massive decontamination effort, which has preserved the safety of most of the country’s fish and agriculture.
None of that is to say radioactive contamination of sea life outside Japan is impossible. Scientists and reporters studying the long-term effects of Fukushima warn that radiation will continue to seep into the Pacific Ocean for years to come. But as of now, those effects are measurable mostly in the waters right off the coast of the disaster site — and even there, most fish are safe to eat.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that several species of marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia have been found with cancer, mutations and radiation as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
None of the photos included in the post have been linked to radiation from the disaster, or even to Japan in general. Studies show that sharks and other marine life are capable of getting cancerous tumors and lesions, albeit not exclusively because of radiation. And while scientists have found elevated levels of radioactive elements in fish off the coast of Fukushima, most sea life is safe to consume — and officials in the U.S. and Australia have not found similar radiation.
The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False."
8,"""One unnamed donor gave $17 million to the Leo-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network to block the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and to support Gorsuch; then a donor — perhaps the same one — gave another $17 million to prop up Kavanaugh.""","on Wednesday, September 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/11/sheldon-whitehouse/its-true-millions-dark-money-has-been-spent-tilt-c/,True,Sheldon Whitehouse,It’s true: millions in dark money has been spent to tilt courts righ,"After the Supreme Court agreed this term to hear a Second Amendment case brought by an NRA affiliate, several Senate Democrats cried foul.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and four other Democratic senators took the unusual step of filing a friend-of-the-court brief imploring the court’s conservative justices to resist right-wing activist pressure. These groups aim to reshape the judiciary to reflect their undisclosed financiers’ interests, the Democrats argued, on everything from expanding the Second Amendment to weakening unions and eroding voting rights.
To influence the court’s composition, Whitehouse said, a combined $34 million in ""dark money"" went toward both blocking President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and confirming President Donald Trump’s two Supreme Court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. 
In a follow-up to the legal brief, Whitehouse in a Sept. 6 Washington Post op-ed described the money as follows: 
""One unnamed donor gave $17 million to the (Leonard) Leo-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network to block the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and to support Gorsuch; then a donor — perhaps the same one — gave another $17 million to prop up Kavanaugh."" 
It can be difficult to trace the path of anonymous political spending with precision, and we wanted to know the factual basis for Whitehouse’s claim. The evidence we found about the money’s origins, and where it went, backed it up. 
‘A network of interlocking nonprofits’
The Judicial Crisis Network is one of several organizations that comprise an opaque network of politically conservative nonprofit organizations who, under the IRS rules, are not required to disclose their donors. (Liberal groups also spend millions on Supreme Court battles, and which side spends more can be hard to track.)
Whitehouse is correct that the Judicial Crisis Network received two donations from undisclosed backers to the tune of $17 million as the Supreme Court confirmation fights were underway. His office pointed us to an article by the transparency groups MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, which linked to the Judicial Crisis Network’s public disclosure documents for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. 
These documents showed a $17.9 million donation in 2016 followed by a $17.1 million donation the next year. Neither donor was revealed, so it’s possible they are the same person or group. Here’s how the contribution appeared in Judicial Crisis Network’s public disclosure from fiscal year 2017:  

The Judicial Crisis Network is among several groups linked to activist Leonard Leo, who has advised President Donald Trump on his judicial picks — and who Whitehouse name-dropped in his op-ed. Leo is the executive vice president of the conservative and libertarian legal association the Federalist Society. But a Washington Post investigation described Leo’s influence in more sweeping terms, referring to him as ""the maestro of a network of interlocking nonprofits,"" who has ""harnessed the nation’s nonprofit system to influence judicial appointments that will shape the nation for decades.""
The Judicial Crisis Network and Federalist Society did not respond to our requests for comment.
Tax filings from the time of the Judicial Crisis Network’s creation in 2005 (then called the Judicial Confirmation Network) show it was based out of the home of Ann and Neil Corkery, who the Washington Post described as Leo’s ""close allies,"" and who have served in various capacities at other groups he’s affiliated with. One of those is the Wellspring Committee, which has donated millions to the Judicial Crisis Network.
Both Neil and Ann Corkery have been listed at various times as the president of Wellspring. And according to MapLight, Daniel Casey, a director for Judicial Crisis Network, is the father of Wellspring director Michael Casey. 
Like the Judicial Crisis Network, the Wellspring Committee was created under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, which means its donors can remain secret. But such organizations are required to disclose who they make grants to.  
Wellspring reported a $14.8 million grant to the Judicial Crisis Network during its 2017 fiscal year. The previous year Wellspring gave the group $23.4 million. According to MapLight, between 2012 and 2015, Wellspring gave the Judicial Crisis Network more than $15 million. (Wellspring dissolved in December 2018.)
Through the work of transparency groups like MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, more information has come to light about the relationship between Wellspring and the Judicial Crisis Network. 
""While we were able to piece together that Wellspring has been Judicial Crisis Network’s top donor many years, Wellspring is also a ‘dark money’ group so the ultimate source of funding remains hidden,"" Anna Massoglia of the Center for Responsive Politics told PolitiFact. ""Wellspring just adds an extra layer of insulation between Judicial Crisis Network and the donor or donors bankrolling the operation.""
Confirmation fights
Whitehouse accurately described the Judicial Crisis Network’s role in the fight over two vacant Supreme Court seats. The group launched a seven-figure advertising campaign days after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016. The aim: to block Obama’s eventual nominee to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court. 
""Today, the Judicial Crisis Network is launching a ‘Let the People Decide’ advertising campaign,"" read a statement from the group’s head Carrie Severino. ""In this first phase, we want to thank the U.S. Senators who say that the American people should decide who picks the next Supreme Court justice.""  
The ads applauded Republican senators like Chuck Grassley of Iowa, then-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who opposed holding confirmation hearings for Obama’s eventual nominee Judge Merrick Garland — which ultimately led to Scalia’s seat remaining vacant into Trump’s presidency.

According to a Judicial Crisis Network press release that has since been removed from their website, the group spent more than $7 million to block Garland’s nomination. The organization then pledged an additional $10 million to support the confirmation of Trump’s nominee Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed to the court on April 7, 2017.
After Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s swing voter, announced his retirement in late June 2018, the Judicial Crisis Network prepared once again to spring into action. With Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh the following month, the group said it would spend at least $10 million on pro-Kavanaugh advertising — the same amount it spent in support of Gorsuch.
Our ruling
Whitehouse said, ""One unnamed donor gave $17 million to the Leo-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network to block the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and to support Gorsuch; then a donor — perhaps the same one — gave another $17 million to prop up Kavanaugh.""
Public disclosure documents show the Judicial Crisis Network received $17.9 million in fiscal year 2016 and $17.1 million the following year. Both came from an undisclosed source during confirmation fights over two vacant Supreme Court seats. (We were unable to determine if it was from a single donor.) Media reports show a number of connections and overlapping interests between the Judicial Crisis Network and the influential conservative activist Leonard Leo.

8,Says a photo shows President Ronald Reagan meeting with Taliban leaders in the White House.,"on Wednesday, September 11th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/11/facebook-posts/no-ronald-reagan-didnt-meet-taliban-because-taliba/,False,Facebook posts,"No, Ronald Reagan didn’t meet with the Taliban because the Taliban didn’t exist | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","President Donald Trump recently announced that he called off talks with the Taliban, a meeting that was set to take place days before the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. 
And while news of that planned meeting inspired criticism, a viral image circulating on social media suggests Trump wouldn’t have been the first U.S. president to have done so, had he gone through with it.
In the image, former President Ronald Reagan is seated in the Oval Office with a group of men wearing turbans. ""NeverTrumpers,"" reads a Sept. 7 tweet that featured the photo, ""A president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!""
Besides being retweeted over 1,700 times, this flawed years-old claim also migrated to Facebook, where, in one version, text surrounding the image declares, ""Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ –Ronald Reagan, 1985.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It’s false on many counts. The men in the photo are not from the Taliban; the organization wasn’t created until years later, in the mid 1990s. Also, the photo was not taken in 1985, and Reagan didn’t compare the group in the photo to the Founding Fathers. 
According to the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum, the photo was captured on Feb. 2, 1983, and shows Reagan meeting with Afghan ""freedom fighters"" in the Oval Office ""to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan.""
The Reagan administration helped fund the Mujahideen to aid their fight against the Soviets. The U.S. pulled the funding after the Soviets retreated and later the Taliban was formed. So, while some of the Mujahideen may have become part of the Taliban a decade after the photo was taken, the two groups are not the same. 
It’s not accurate that Reagan likened the pictured men to the Founding Fathers. 
The quote’s likely origins are in in a speech Reagan delivered at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 1, 1985. But he wasn’t talking about the Taliban or the Afghan fighters seated with him in the photo. He was, in fact, talking about Nicaraguan rebels:
""I've spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they're fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance. We cannot turn away from them, for the struggle here is not right versus left; it is right versus wrong.""
Our ruling
Social media posts claim a photo of President Reagan seated in the Oval Office shows him meeting with members of the Taliban.
This is flat-out wrong. The image was taken in 1983, about a decade before the Taliban formed, and featured Afghan rebels fighting against Soviet occupation in Afghanistan.

The post is tagged with two labels — props and scarecrows — and the person who posted the photo under the name ""Marrow"" responded to some commenters admiring his handiwork.

8,"China has ""had now the worst year in 57 years.""","on Tuesday, September 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/10/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-china-having-its-worst-year-5/,Mostly False,Donald Trump,Trump wrongly claims China is having its ‘worst year in 57 years’,"President Donald Trump exaggerated China’s economic slowdown during a recent rally for congressional candidate Dan Bishop in Fayetteville, N.C.
""I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they’ve had now the worst year in 57 years,"" he said during the Sept. 9 speech.
It’s true that China’s economy is slumping, but 57 years ago, the country was still suffering from a massive famine brought on by Mao Zedong’s economic policies that historians say killed as many as 45 million people. We found it impossible to believe that today’s China is just as bad.
In reality, China’s economy is growing at its slowest rate in about 27 or 29 — not 57 — years.
Slowed GDP growth
The Trump campaign did not say what Trump was referring to, but based on similar statements he’s made in the past, it’s likely that he was talking about economic growth. 
China’s gross domestic product grew 6.2% in the second quarter, marking its slowest pace since the first quarter of 1992, the earliest quarterly data available on record. But that’s the slowest quarterly growth in 27 years, not 57. 
The slowdown matched analysts’ predictions, as the International Monetary Fund projected that China’s GDP would grow 6.2% over the course of 2019. The last time China’s GDP grew less than 6.2% in a year’s time was in 1990 — 29 years ago — when it grew just 3.9%.
But China saw much harder times before that. For a number of years during the 1960s and ‘70s, the economy was in far worse shape than it is now, according to data from the World Bank.
""In the past 57 years China has had some very bad years in terms of growth and social development,"" said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s China Center. ""The current situation is nowhere near as dire as any of those other periods."" 
The Trump campaign pointed to a Wall Street Journal report suggesting China’s growth could be weaker than its official data lets on.
""Some economists who have dissected China’s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge,"" the report said.
But even if China’s GDP growth rate was closer to 3.2%, Trump’s 57-year figure would remain a stretch, since China’s GDP was contracting as recently as 1976, 43 years ago.
Oddly enough, the president accurately described China’s economic slide as the ""worst in 27 years"" several times in July and August before experimenting with other timelines.
Recently, Trump had said China’s economy was at its worst point in ""30, 40 years,"" ""54 years,"" ""52 or 54 years,"" ""30 to 50 years"" and ""61 years."" 
Reports in the Wall Street Journal have also made note of China’s falling currency and diminishing industrial production. But as the New York Times noted, those economic metrics show China struggling, but not to the point of breaking 57-year records. 
In August, the Chinese yuan tumbled to its lowest value in 11 years. And in July, China’s industrial output growth slowed to 4.8% from a year earlier, a 17-year low.
Mary Lovely, professor of economics at Syracuse University and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said China’s economic slump is not particularly shocking to those who track economic growth data.
""As an economy develops, growth rates come down,"" she said. ""Over the long term, we have seen China’s average growth rate decline, which is what we would expect.""
In the United States, for example, the growth rate is much lower — it was 2.8% in 2018, according to the World Bank — because growth is more dependent on technological advances than making efficient use of existing resources, Lovely said.
Our ruling
Trump said China has ""had now the worst year in 57 years.""
China’s GDP recently grew at its slowest quarterly rate in 27 years, and it is projected to grow at its slowest yearly rate in 29 years. So China’s economy is slowing. But it’s not at its worst point in 57 years.

We reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post to see where they got it, but we haven’t heard back.
We could find no evidence that Trump personally donated $1 million to Bahamas relief efforts. News outlets have not covered such a move, and the White House itself hasn’t released any statements about Dorian-related donations. If the president had, it’s reasonable to assume the move would have received some attention.
We reached out to the White House to confirm, but we haven’t heard back. However, million-dollar donations to hurricane relief funds aren’t entirely outside the realm of possibility. 
Several high-profile companies and celebrities, including Disney and Michael Jordan, have pledged $1 million to Dorian victims. So have cruise brands like Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line. And, following Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Trump did donate $1 million of his own money to charities helping with recovery efforts in Houston — a move that was announced by the White House at the time.
But there’s no evidence that Trump has made a similar commitment for the Bahamas. We rate the Facebook post False."

In Greenberg’s book, ""RIP GOP: How the New America Is Dooming the Republicans,"" he wrote a chapter titled ""How did Democrats let Trump win?"" In it, he argues that Obama-era Democratic messaging on the economy wasn’t breaking through to Americans who continued to feel worried about the economy.
""What was the reality for most Americans during the Obama presidency? Most lost wealth and their incomes fell, particularly for those at the bottom of the ladder,"" Greenberg wrote.
Is that correct? Mostly, though it depends a bit on when you start counting.
Wealth patterns during the Obama era
To measure the ups and downs of wealth during Obama’s presidency we first turned to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. 
We started by looking at the trends in wealth holdings among several portions of the income spectrum in 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2019. (The survey data is collected every three years.)
As the chart below shows, the only increase in wealth during that period accrued to the top 10% of the income spectrum, which saw a 27% rise in wealth. The bottom 80% lost wealth, either a little or a lot. Losses ranged from half a percentage point to 70%
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
 
To the individuals facing such losses, the starting point may not matter much, but since Greenberg singled out Obama’s tenure in office, economists suggested we also look at the pattern beginning in 2010, to deemphasize the impact of the Great Recession, which Obama inherited.
If you use 2010 as the baseline, the picture looks significantly more favorable to Obama. From 2010 to 2016, only the lowest 20 percent of the income range saw their wealth decline. For every other percentile, wealth rose, with the increases ranging from 12% to 24%.
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
 
Meanwhile, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, cautioned that these traditional measures are skewed against lower-income Americans, who may lack big bank accounts and 401(k) balances and may not be homeowners but who can expect to receive payments from Social Security and Medicare that will usually return more than they paid in.
Income patterns during the Obama era
To determine whether incomes fell during Obama’s presidency, we turned to a study we’ve cited previously by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
This study looked at how much income people received compared with what they received in 1979.
The chart below -- which doesn’t count taxes and federal payments, such as Social Security -- shows that between 2008, the year before Obama took office, and 2015, the final year of the study, inflation-adjusted income was essentially flat for the bottom 80% of earners. Income rose only for the top one-fifth of earners.
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
 
However, if you use data that takes transfers (such as government benefits) and taxes into account -- things that Obama would have had some influence on -- the picture is somewhat more favorable. The bottom 20% saw their income rise by 29% above inflation during the Obama years, and for those between the 21st to 80th percentile, it rose by 13%.
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
 
Our ruling
Greenberg said, ""What was the reality for most Americans during the Obama presidency? Most lost wealth and their incomes fell, particularly for those at the bottom of the ladder.""
Over the course of Obama’s presidency, wealth and income did either stagnate or decline. However, this full tenure included a precipitous drop from the Great Recession that Obama inherited, so the numbers look better if you start counting from the depths of the recession instead. The Obama team can claim they accomplished positive growth on the economy, while Greenberg is right that many everyday Americans still suffered losses. 
We rate the statement Mostly True."
8,"Says he ""led the fight to expand Medicaid.""","on Tuesday, September 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/sep/10/chris-jones/did-chris-jones-lead-medicaid-expansion-virginia-y/,Half-True,Chris Jones,Did Chris Jones lead the fight for Medicaid expansion in Virginia? | PolitiFact Virgin,"Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, is introducing himself to voters in his newly-redrawn district as the champion of Medicaid expansion in Virginia. The Democratic Party of Virginia says his claim is bogus.
Jones, the powerful chairman of the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee, is airing a 30-second ad showing him at work as a pharmacist.
""Chris Jones opened Bennet’s Creek Pharmacy, offering quality, affordable health care,"" the narrator says. ""That’s why he led the fight to expand Medicaid and improve our mental health system.""
The ad shifts to L.D. Britt, a surgeon and professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School. ""Chris Jones - to get expansion, that is a major accomplishment,"" he says.The screen flashes: ‘CHRIS JONES EXPANDED MEDICAID for 400,000 VIRGINIANS.""
The state Democratic party, in an Aug. 20 news release, denounced Jones’ ad as ""a craven attempt to mislead his constituents."" The Democrats said Jones spent years ""fighting tooth and nail to deny thousands of people in his community access to affordable health care.""
So we fact-checked Jones’ claim that he led the expansion fight and found that its accuracy varies, depending on the year.
Jones’ was a point man in a 2018 bipartisan compromise that allowed Medicaid to cover more than 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. But his ad doesn’t say that from 2013 to 2017, he played a leading part in blocking it.
The roles Jones and other legislators played in Medicaid expansion could be a big issue this fall when all 140 General Assembly seats are on ballots. Democrats need to flip one seat in the Senate and two in the House to control of both chambers for the first time since 1999.
House Democrats may be aided by a 2018 judicial finding that some election districts had been racially gerrymandered. Court-ordered remapping has placed six Republicans incumbents - including Jones and Speaker Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights - in newly-shaped districts with a majority of Democratic voters. 
Jones’ old district, which elected him 11 times, was 56% Republican, 44% Democratic, according to the non-partisan Virginia Public Access Project. His new district is 43% red, 57% blue. Jones is being challenged by Clint Jenkins, a realtor and local Democratic activist. 
Let’s take a deeper look at Jones’ record on Medicaid expansion, starting with the early years.
Jones, 2013 to 2017
States were offered an option to expand their Medicaid programs to cover households earning up to 138% of the poverty line, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. The Affordable Care Act - or Obamacare - promised the federal government would pay all expansion costs at first, and never less than 90%. 
Republican leaders - including outgoing Gov. Bob McDonnell and then-Speaker Bill  Howell - declared their opposition in early 2013, saying they didn’t trust the federal pledge to pick up most of the expansion costs and that Virginia’s program was too inefficient to let grow. The state’s Medicaid costs during the previous decade had grown an average 9% a year, according to the Joint Subcommittee for Health and Human Resources.
Jones was on a team of budget negotiators that year that created a commission to find efficiencies in Virginia’s program that might open the door to future expansion.
Democrat Terry McAuliffe became governor in 2014 and made Medicaid expansion a top priority, accusing Republicans of turning down a federal windfall. Jones told reporters that January, ""I don’t see any possibility of expansion this session,"" and repeated his reforms-first mantra. 
Jones undercut McAuliffe’s efforts to work expansion into the state budget and opposed it in a partisan floor vote. During a Feb. 20, 2014 floor speech, he said expansion should include a work requirement for able, adult Medicaid recipients.  The Washington Post, in a June 23, 2014 article, identified Jones as ""a leader in the fight against Medicaid expansion.""
McAuliffe tried again to expand Medicaid during the final three years of his term. Each time, Jones and his Appropriations Committee stripped it from the budget. ""He knows we’re not going to give him that,"" Jones said in Dec. 16, 2016.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch - in an April 6, 2017 article - reported that Jones was on a team of five Republican budget negotiators for the House who ""have steadfastly opposed Medicaid expansion.""  
At the time, Republicans occupied 66 of the 100 House seats. But they were rocked in 2017 elections when Democrats gained 15 seats and cut the GOP’s majority to one vote. Speaker Howell, a staunch opponent of expansion, didn’t run re-election. Democrat Ralph Northam was elected governor. In the changed political landscape, lawmakers were willing to deal.
Jones, 2018
With the blessings of Cox, the new speaker, Jones presented House Republicans with a budget option to expand Medicaid. It won enough support to pass the House with strong Democratic backing. The deal had two key components:
*A work requirement for able-bodied adults on Medicaid. The Trump administration announced on Jan. 11, 2018 it would allow states to establish such programs, clearing uncertainty among Virginia Republicans.
*Hospitals would pay the state’s expansion costs through a new provider tax, an idea proposed by McAuliffe in 2015 and conditionally backed that year by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. Hospitals concluded that, even with the tax, they would come out ahead because the expansion would cut their losses in treating uninsured patients. 
The hospital tax eased GOP concerns that, if the federal government lowered its financial commitment to expansion, the state would be stuck with a large bill. Jones was also able to point to a report showing the efficiency commission had lowered state Medicaid costs by $43 million a year.
Jones fine-tuned the deal with Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, the co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Hanger withstood heavy criticism from Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, and gained a few crucial Republican votes.
The final deal passed the House in a 68-30 vote to approve the budget, with 21 of 50 Republicans in support. It passed the Senate, 23-17, with four of 21 Republicans in support. 
During a June 7 ceremony on Capitol steps, Northam signed the state budget that expanded Medicaid. He credited three Republicans: Jones, Cox and Hanger. Northam said he would save a signing pen for Jones, who didn’t attend the event because of work.
Jones’ view
Jones says that - unlike many of his Republican colleagues - he never took a hardline position against expansion. He says he consistently said he’d be open to expansion if Virginia's Medicaid program was first streamlined, and that happened. The hospital tax was also key,
""It was always the question of how do we pay for this,"" he said during an Aug. 23 interview.
Jones defended his campaign ad. ""I was the chief architect of Medicaid expansion as it is today,"" he said, also giving credit to Hanger and the Northam administration. ""I was the point person in this. I got if off the floor.""
Addressing the Democratic Party’s criticism of his commercial, Jones said, ""Maybe they would have preferred for me to say, ‘I led the fight to responsibly expand Medicaid.’""
Our Ruling
In a TV ad, Jones claims he ""led the fight to expand Medicaid""  in Virginia.
Jones played an enormous role in the 2018 passage of expansion. He was a go-to man in building a bipartisan compromise on an issue that had divided Democrats and Republicans for years. Gov. Northam, a Democrat, has acknowledged Jones’ role. 
But the fight to expand Medicaid began in 2013, and during the first four years Jones spearheaded the Republican majority’s resistance. He opposed expansion in a floor vote. As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, he repeatedly helped strip expansion from proposed state budgets.
Jones credibly says he never shut the door on expansion and helped bring Medicaid efficiencies that made the expansion palatable to other Republicans. But it also can be said that Jones helped deny health insurance to 400,000 Virginians for four years. Twenty-nine states expanded their coverage before Virginia.
Jones’ ad claim addresses half of a complicated story. So we rate it Half True."
8,"Thirty-four of the 47 men depicted in the famous ""Declaration of Independence"" painting were slaveholders.","on Tuesday, September 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/10/arlen-parsa/evidence-shows-most-47-men-famous-declaration-inde/,True,Arlen Parsa,Evidence shows most of the 47 men in famous 'Declaration of Independence' painting were slaveholders,"As the nation observes the 400th anniversary of slavery, a Chicago documentary filmmaker tweeted about the painting Declaration of Independence, which hangs in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.
The painting depicts a moment in 1776 showing 47 men, including Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock and Ben Franklin, most of whom were signers of the declaration.
""This is one of the most famous paintings in American history: Declaration of Independence,"" Arlen Parsa wrote above an image of the 1818 oil by John Trumbull. ""I decided to put red dots on all the men who held slaves. Next time someone puts them on a pedestal and says we can't question their judgement on guns or whatever, show them this image.""
So, Parsa claims that 34 of the 47 founding fathers shown in the painting were slaveholders. 
With the caveat that there is no one definitive source on this question, we also counted 34.
A research challenge
We contacted more than a dozen historians and historical organizations. None knew of a list that identified how many of the men in the painting were slaveholders.
""I would have assumed that it would be easy to find out how many owned slaves, but it is surprisingly elusive,"" Baylor University history professor Thomas Kidd told us.
Starting with evidence Parsa provided to back up his claim, we did our own research on each of the 47. (This chart identifies all 47.)
Go here to see a spreadsheet detailing the evidence we examined.
""Most of the quantification is best-guess and based on available records,"" said historian Terry Bouton at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ""The problem is that property records are pretty spotty for the more obscure founders and even some of the bigger names.""
But, using books, historical organizations, research articles and other sources, we found there is strong evidence to back Parsa’s claim. The slaveholders tended to be men of means, including landowners, doctors, lawyers and local government officials. 
Here are the 34 men in the painting we found to be slaveholders, in alphabetical order by last name:
Josiah Bartlett, Charles Carroll, Samuel Chase, Abraham Clark, George Clinton, John Dickinson, William Floyd, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock,  Benjamin Harrison, Joseph Hewes, Thomas Heyward Jr., William Hooper, Stephen Hopkins, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee.
And Francis Lewis, Philip Livingston, Robert R. Livingston, Thomas Lynch, Arthur Middleton, Lewis Morris, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Read, Benjamin Rush, Edward Rutledge, Richard Stockton, William Whipple, Thomas Willing, John Witherspoon, Oliver Wolcott and George Wythe.
The men who did not own slaves also tended to be well-to-do. Here are the 13 who apparently did not own slaves:
John Adams, Samuel Adams, George Clymer, William Ellery, Elbridge Gerry, Samuel Huntington, Thomas McKean, Robert Treat Paine, Roger Sherman, Charles Thomson, George Walton, William Williams and James Willson.
Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz noted that at least three men in the painting, including Franklin, were or later became abolitionists.
Also, in 1776, slavery was legal in all 13 of the new states and was ""condoned by the entire West,"" including Britain and France, he said.
""As the men who drafted and signed the Declaration were mostly gentlemen of standing and property, it's not at all surprising that this would be the case,"" Wilentz added.
Brown University emeritus history professor Gordon Wood said Parsa’s claim reveals how prevalent slavery was. 
But, ""what's important is that slavery began to be attacked and eliminated from that moment on,"" Wood said. ""The first anti-slave convention in history was held in Philadelphia in 1775. The American Revolution made slavery a problem for the world when it had not been a problem before, having existed for thousands of years without substantial criticism. All this is lost in today’s climate.""
Our ruling
Parsa said 34 of the 47 men depicted in the famous ""Declaration of Independence"" painting were slaveholders.
We found strong evidence to back the claim on the 34, recognizing there is no one definitive source on the question.
We rate the statement True."

While Hart reportedly has a long road of recovery ahead of him, he and his vocal cords have not been paralyzed.
According to several news reports, Hart suffered three spinal fractures and underwent surgery after the crash but did not suffer any paralysis, nerve damage or numbness. While Hart has a long recovery ahead, he is reportedly already walking; his wife, Eniko Parrish, told TMZ he was ""awake"" and is ""going to be just fine."" 
The post appears to have originated from a story on LFR Solutions, a website known to make up fake stories about celebrities. 
The story says that, according to ""medical sources at UCLA Medical center"" Hart ""suffered trauma to the nerves in his spine and throat which have left him paralyzed from the neck down. In addition to being diagnosed with quadriplegia, he also suffered trauma in his neck, causing irreversible damage to his larynx, leaving both vocal cords paralyzed.""
It then credits the statement found in the Facebook post to an unnamed Hart representative.
The website attempts to make it look like it posts legitimate entertainment news, but buried at the very bottom of the page in tiny, barely legible writing (3.5 font size to be exact) is a disclaimer that everything on the site is satire: 
""THE STORIES POSTED ON LFRSOLUTIONS.COM ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. THE STORIES MAY MIMIC ARTICLES FOUND IN THE HEADLINES, BUT REST ASSURED THEY ARE PURELY SATIRICAL.""
Beyond the disclaimer’s impossibly small text, when a portion of a fake story is lifted from a satire site and posted separately on social media, users have no chance of coming across a disclaimer.

9,"""There are 390 million guns out on the streets of a country of 329 million people.""","on Monday, September 9th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/sep/09/beto-orourke/how-many-guns-are-streets-united-states/,True,Beto O'Rourke,How many guns are on the streets in the United States? | PolitiFact Texas,"During an appearance on PBS’s Amanpour & Company, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke discussed Walmart’s recent decision to stop the sale of ammunition that can be used in assault rifles and to ask customers to not openly carry firearms in its stores.
The decision came in the wake of an Aug. 3 mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart, where a gunman killed 22 people.
O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, called Walmart’s decision ""a great example of corporate responsibility"" and a ""step in the right direction.""
""But if we wait for this kind of corporate responsibility across the country given the number of gun shows and gun dealers and gun stores, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives,"" O’Rourke said. ""There are 390 million guns out on the streets of a country of 329 million people. We have to take decisive action and it has to come from our government.""
Is O’Rourke right on his figures about the number of guns in the country? The last time PolitiFact looked at these numbers, it was estimated that there were roughly 310 million civilian-owned guns in the United States.
New survey
Chris Evans, a spokesman for O’Rourke, pointed to a report published by the Global Small Arms Survey in May 2019 that found there are more civilian-owned firearms in the United States than in any other country.
The Small Arms Survey, an operation at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, found that there were more than 393 million civilian firearms holdings in the United States, as of June 2018.
The report also detailed firearms owned by the U.S. military — about 4.5 million — and by law enforcement agencies — about 1 million.
The group’s estimates are developed using a variety of data sources and its work is considered by experts to be the most comprehensive research that exists on private gun ownership globally.
In the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives publishes annual reports about the number of firearms that have been manufactured, exported and imported. It also looks at the number of federal licenses issued to manufacturers.
But a spokesman for the agency said it does not have an aggregate figure for the total number of guns in circulation.
A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 1996 there were 242 million civilian-owned firearms; in 2000 there were 259 million; and in 2009 there were 310 million.
The figure for 2009 was significant, as it marked the first year that the number of civilian-owned firearms surpassed the nation’s total population, according to the Washington Post.
Evans pointed to reporting from the Washington Post on the latest Small Arms Survey report, an article titled: ""There are more guns than people in the United States, according to a new study of global firearm ownership.""
The Washington Post found that, using the estimate from the Small Arms Survey, there are enough civilian-owned firearms in the United States ""for every man, woman and child to own one and still have 67 million guns left over.""
At the end of June 2018, when the estimate was published, the United States’ population was roughly 327 million. Today, it is more than 329 million.
Globally, researchers with the group estimate that 85% of the 1 billion firearms in global circulation are in civilian hands — that’s 857 million guns. Of the remaining guns, roughly 13% are in military use and 2% are owned by law enforcement agencies.
The number of firearms around the world has increased substantially, largely due to an increase in civilians purchasing guns, researchers found.
The number of civilian-owned guns worldwide grew from 650 million in 2006 to 857 million in 2017.
The United States makes up the bulk of all civilian-owned firearms.
""Even after adjusting for population, it is clear that the United States far outnumbers other countries,"" reads a release from the group. ""The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but its civilians hold almost 40% of the world’s firearms.""
Our Ruling
O’Rourke said, ""There are 390 million guns out on the streets of a country of 329 million people.""
The latest study of civilian-owned firearms in the United States supports this statement. We rate this claim True.

TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing."
9,"""We’ve got 600-plus police and fire pensions Downstate that are on the cusp of insolvency because they don’t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going.""","on Sunday, September 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/sep/08/lori-lightfoot/lightfoot-stretches-numbers-downstate-public-safet/,Mostly False,Lori Lightfoot,Lightfoot stretches the numbers on Downstate public safety pension funds | PolitiFact Illinois,"The day after her televised ""State of the City"" address, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot made a series of editorial board stops to discuss the city’s major budgetary challenges.
At the top of her list was Chicago’s pension debt, which has ballooned to $30 billion across its four public employee funds.
In her opening remarks to the Chicago Sun-Times editorial board, Lightfoot said she hoped her speech would serve as ""a call to arms"" for not only Chicago residents but Illinoisans in other cities and towns grappling with chronically underfunded pensions. That underscores a theme from her address that the state must band together to partner in reform.
Like Chicago, state government faces its own massive pension overhang. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has ruled out the state stepping in to take over municipal funds, saying that to do so would reduce its credit rating to junk status. However, he has left open the possibility that municipal pension funds could consolidate, pooling their assets to boost investment returns.
During her sit-down with the Sun-Times, Lightfoot was asked how she would keep the rest of the state from viewing an all-in approach on pensions as Chicago getting a ""bailout"" from the state, something critics Downstate claim the city often receives. She responded with this:
""We’ve got 600-plus police and fire pensions Downstate that are on the cusp of insolvency because they don’t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going,"" she said. ""They’ve done all the things that we have done historically: raised property taxes, sold assets, had their ratings reduced by rating agencies, and they’re out of levers to pull, so they need help just as we do. So this isn’t a Chicago-specific thing.""
Lightfoot is correct that cities and towns outside Chicago are pressured with mounting pension debt. By raising the specter of insolvency, however, the mayor suggests the situation faced by the vast majority of Downstate public safety pension funds is far more dire than it really is.
Her claim raises questions on its face because the number she cited references the rough tally for all Downstate police and fire pension funds — not just those with severe funding gaps.
Each year, Downstate police and fire pension funds file a report with the Illinois Department of Insurance, or DOI. Data from 2017 filings made by 632 such funds were compiled in a July report by the state legislature’s bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.
Collectively, the unfunded liabilities for those funds rose to $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, the commission found, and they had the assets needed to cover 55% of their liabilities. While that’s far from the 90% funding level the state requires them to reach by 2040, it doesn’t suggest most will soon be shuttering. That same year, unfunded liabilities for Chicago’s police and fire funds reached nearly $14.5 billion.
""I think highlighting that there are lots of police and fire pension systems that are underfunded is accurate,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago. ""I don’t think it’s accurate to indicate that the majority are on the brink of insolvency.""
After we reached out to the mayor’s office for clarification, her spokeswoman sent us a response that did not back up Lightfoot’s specific claim.
""The mayor’s point that municipalities throughout the state are struggling with their pension obligations is an important one,"" spokeswoman Anel Ruiz wrote in an email. ""Approximately 30% of the 632 public safety pension funds in the state are currently funded at ratios of under 50 percent, according to the Department of Insurance.""
That math tracks with the DOI data included in the commission’s report. For comparison, Chicago’s police and fire pensions are both funded at levels below 25%. Just 25 Downstate public safety funds have a ratio lower than that, records show.
But Lightfoot didn’t just reference the declining health of some Downstate public safety funds in the aggregate. Instead, she said more than 600 Downstate pensions are ""on the cusp of insolvency.""
Our ruling
Lightfoot said more than 600 police and fire pension funds in Downstate Illinois ""are on the cusp of insolvency because they don’t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going.""
The source for that figure refers to the total number of Downstate public safety pensions — not just those in financial distress. And while the average funded ratio for those funds is far from the target set by the state, experts told us it’s not accurate to claim that nearly all of them are nearing a point where they won’t be able to make payments to current retirees.
We rate Lightfoot’s claim Mostly False.

The footage comes from a rally in Greenville, N.C., in July when Trump endorsed Bishop and attacked his opponent. Even though the words come from Trump, the Bishop campaign chose to use the claim in its ad, so we are rating Bishop in this fact-check. 
Next, the ad shows McCready alongside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez while a voiceover drones, ""Dan McCready, a liberal backed by radicals who want open borders and socialized medicine.""
Other Republicans have made similar charges about McCready, the Democratic nominee, being a socialist, so we decided to check it out.
We’re mindful that this is a familiar page from the Republican playbook. PolitiFact has explored many similar claims about Barack Obama, Sen. Bill Nelson and three members of the Ohio congressional delegation, among others. (In the case of the Ohio Democrats, not just socialists, but ""card-carrying socialists."") Those claims were all rated Pants on Fire.
And so it’s no surprise that Bishop’s claim is also ridiculously false. In fact, McCready is a business owner who proudly proclaims himself a capitalist.
McCready distances himself from left-wing national politicians
Under socialism, the government controls the means of production. But McCready hasn’t called for the end of the private sector. To the contrary, he started his own clean energy investment firm, Double Time Capital. 
We contacted Bishop’s campaign to find out what evidence it had of McCready’s socialist leanings and got no reply. 
So we tried on our own. We searched McCready’s website and his statements and found no evidence to back up the claim from Bishop’s ad.
The National Republican Congressional Committee suggested that McCready was a socialist in a May statement linking him with ""his party’s radical ideas such as infanticide, a socialist takeover of the entire economy with the Green New Deal and government-run socialized health care.""
That’s a common tactic, said Dr. J. Michael Bitzer, history and politics professor at Catawba College. Republicans often try to group local Democratic candidates with more liberal national politicians to sway voters. 
""First, it was tying all Democratic candidates to Nancy Pelosi in 2018 to try to lower their favorability. Then, with the president going after AOC and the Squad, guilt by association has become a standard mantra for Republican campaigns,"" Bitzer said.
In fact, experts say McCready intentionally has distanced himself from left-wing Democrats in Congress. One Washington Post article tallies all of the ways he’s done that: ""He pledged not to support Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. He opposed impeachment. He returned a donation from Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota after she suggested that Israel's advocates were buying off Congress.""
McCready doesn’t support open borders or socialized medicine
A recent Trump tweet echoed that McCready ""wants Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities, and Socialism."" (PolitiFact checked Trump’s claim about McCready’s immigration stances and rated it Mostly False.)
McCready’s policy proposals are a far cry from socialist. They often don’t even go as far as the mainstream Democratic platform.
""There’s some distance between McCready and the national Democratic platform,"" said Dr. Susan Roberts, political science professor at Davidson College. ""He does not support Medicare for All. He does not support a ban on assault weapons.""
Also, he’s repeatedly dismissed the Green New Deal and other policies embraced by many Democratic presidential candidates.
In a CNN interview, McCready scoffed at Bishop’s attacks. ""Unfortunately for him, he's not running against a socialist. He's running against a capitalist who's built a business from scratch.""
Our ruling
Bishop, Trump, and the NRCC are trying to portray the Democratic candidate McCready as a socialist, but there’s simply no evidence to support their absurd charge. 
McCready is a businessman who has benefited from capitalism and even has distanced himself from liberal Democrats. 
As election day nears, we need to take a match to the Truth-O-Meter. Pants on Fire!"
9,Says a Donald Trump tweet credited Gov.

Ron DeSantis for Hurricane Dorian’s path | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"President Donald Trump has tweeted a lot about Hurricane Dorian. But one popular Facebook post fabricates a tweet from the president that he never wrote.
The post, published Sept. 1, claims to show a screenshot of a tweet from Trump. In it, Trump credits Dorian’s northward path away from the Florida coast on the state’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, saying that, if Democrat Andrew Gillum had won the midterm election, ""millions would have died.""
But the tweet is a fake. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
On first glance, the account in the screenshot appears to belong to the president. It bears the same photo as his real account, @realDonaldTrump, and even the handle looks similar.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
But it’s not. The suspect tweet bears the handle @realdonalbtrump — with a ""b"" where the ""d"" should be. It also has a misplaced period at the end of Trump’s name and does not have a blue verification badge, which means the account doesn’t actually belong to the president.
Further, in its Twitter bio, @realdonalbtrump says it’s a parody account.
""NOT the real Donald Trump, just PARODY,"" the bio reads. ""If you thought it was really him for a second what does that say about him?""
Yet hundreds of Facebook users are sharing the screenshot as if it were true. Just to make sure, we checked Trump’s real Twitter page to see if he has tweeted about Gillum in connection to Dorian. He hasn’t.
The Facebook post is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!"
9,"Says she ""sued Exxon Mobil"" as California attorney general.","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/california/statements/2019/sep/06/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-said-she-sued-exxon-mobil-california/,False,Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris claimed she ‘sued Exxon Mobil’ as California AG. She didn’t. | PolitiFact Californ,"During a climate town hall on CNN this week, Democratic presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris vowed to take on Big Oil and other powerful interests when they ""profit off of harmful behaviors"" such as burning fossil fuels.
In answer to a direct question, she claimed she already did that as California’s attorney general. 
""So, Senator Harris, what would you do? Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?"" asked moderator Erin Burnett.
""I have sued Exxon Mobil,"" Harris replied. 
Did she? 
Environmental groups questioned her response. 
We decided to fact check it.  
Our research
We found Harris’ office investigated Exxon in 2016 over allegations it lied to the public and its shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change. The Los Angeles Times detailed that probe in a January 2016 news article. It said Exxon rejected the allegations.  
But there’s no public record, and nothing that Harris’ campaign could provide, to show she filed a lawsuit against the company. 
""The facts are Harris opened an investigation against Exxon for lying about climate change. She didn’t take that further even though she should have and other attorney generals did,"" said Kassie Siegel, climate director at the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. ""She did bring some cases against oil companies. I’m not aware of a case that she actually brought against Exxon. And she didn’t bring the case against Exxon for lying about climate change."" 
Ian Sams, a campaign spokesman for Harris, told us she ""launched an investigation into Exxon,"" but he would not directly address her claim that she sued the company. 
He told The New York Times that, ""as attorney general (Harris) sued Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 for pollution activities, helping win $50 million in settlements."" Sams provided PolitiFact California with links to articles and news releases supporting those actions. 
In their own fact checks, the Times and CNN reported they found no evidence supporting Harris’ claim that she sued Exxon. 
""As Cal AG, Harris opened a file shortly after the #ExxonKnew news broke in fall 2015. She never did anything with it,"" RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic Party's environmental caucus and president of the Climate Hawks Vote Super PAC, said on Twitter during the town hall.
Our rating
Sen. Kamala Harris claimed at a recent climate town hall that she ""sued Exxon Mobil"" as California attorney general. 
She opened an investigation into the oil giant over allegations it was lying to the public and its shareholders about climate change. But there’s no public evidence, or any from her campaign, that she ever filed a lawsuit against the company. 
Harris did sue other oil companies and win settlements over allegations they violated various state laws governing hazardous materials, according to information provided by her campaign. But none of that includes a lawsuit against Exxon. 
Harris clearly tangled with Big Oil as California AG. There’s just no record she sued one of the industry’s biggest companies, Exxon. 
We rate her claim False.

9,"After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, ""the typical American worker’s pay growing at more than 3 percent a year, record low unemployment.""","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/new-york/statements/2019/sep/06/tom-reed/reed-points-economic-gains/,Half-True,Tom Reed,Reed points to economic gains | PolitiFact New York,"Rep. Tom Reed, R-Corning, recently tied his claims about the strength of the economy to the tax code changes signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017. 
""Recession? I don’t think so,"" Reed tweeted. ""Our economy is booming after tax cuts. The typical American worker’s pay is growing at more than 3 percent a year. Record low unemployment. Retail spending up big."" 
 
Recession? I don't think so.Our economy is booming after tax cuts...✅The typical American worker’s pay growing at more than 3 percent a year.✅Record low unemployment.✅Retail spending up big. pic.twitter.com/VeIft20cxd— Tom Reed (@RepTomReed) August 20, 2019 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and made changes to business tax deductions. For individual filers, the act increased the standard deduction and child credit while eliminating personal exemptions, among other changes, such as capping the state and local tax deduction at $10,000.
It is true that median worker pay has increased and the unemployment rate is down. But Reed intimated the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is responsible for the economic gains. We asked Reed’s office about the link. Reed's spokesman did not refute that he made such a connection, nor did he provide evidence establishing a link between them.  We wondered if the federal tax law is responsible, as Reed implied, for American workers’ pay increasing and the lower unemployment.  
The gains
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that as of July 2019, median worker pay increased by 3.7 percent over the last year. When inflation is accounted for, wage growth was 2 percent during the same period.
Reed’s spokesman, Will Reinert, pointed us to that data, and economists we spoke with described it as the most reliable data on the topic. 
Several economists said Reed’s claim about wage growth is true, though to get a true picture of how well wages are staying ahead of inflation, inflation must be part of the calculation. However, just because inflation isn’t factored in doesn’t make Reed’s claim false, said Benjamin Page, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. 
As for unemployment, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Aug. 2 that as of July 2019, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent. Historical data from the labor statistics bureau shows that the unemployment rate has generally fallen since a high of 10 percent in October 2009. Looking back to 1948, the unemployment rate has been lower than the current rate of 3.7 percent in the late 1960s but also in the 1950s and in 1948.
Tax law effect
Reed tweeted: ""Our economy is booming after tax cuts.""
But is it booming because of tax cuts?
In May, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said the effects were minimal.
""On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy,"" analysts wrote. ""Although examining the growth rates cannot indicate the effects of the tax cut on GDP, it does tend to rule out very large effects in the near term."" On wages, analysts found that ""ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates.""
We also interviewed four economists about Reed’s claims. 
Page, of the Tax Policy Center, said the tax law had some effect, though the unemployment rate and wage growth are consistent with historical trends. Since 2015, two years before the law was passed, median weekly earnings have been growing, on average, at 3 percent, he said.
""It’s not something that all of the sudden happened,"" he said.   
Leonard Burman, a professor at Syracuse University and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis in the Treasury Department, said that the tax law and spending increases signed by Trump boosted the economy primarily by increasing households’ disposable income, but that economists ""cannot precisely measure the current effects of the tax cut as compared with many other important factors."" 
""The main explanation for the statistics that Congressman Reed cites is that we are at the peak of the business cycle,"" Burman said. 
Neel Rao, an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University at Buffalo, said Reed’s claims have ""some basis in fact,"" but that ""it’s not the whole story."" Rao said there is no solid evidence linking what is happening in the labor market to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show, unemployment has been on a downward trend before the tax reform package went into effect.  
Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the free-market American Enterprise Institute, agreed that wages are rising nominally by 3 percent per year and that unemployment is at historic lows, but that there isn’t enough evidence that the tax reform package had anything to do with it. 
""If you look at the trend in average wages and employment before and after December 2017, there is nothing to suggest that the (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) has had an impact on that trend,"" Mathur said. Both unemployment and wages were ""trending smoothly"" well before the tax legislation was passed, she said. 
Our ruling
After tax cuts, Reed said, unemployment is at a record low and that average worker pay is rising by more than 3 percent. 
That's not in dispute, with the caveat that unemployment was lower in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. But he implies it is because of the tax cuts, and that's not the case, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the economists we talked to. The economic indicators were trending that way before the law was passed in 2017. 
His statement is partially accurate. There have been economic gains. But he takes things out of context when he neglects to mention economists and a nonpartisan congressional research report indicate the tax cuts didn't have much to do with it.
We rate Reed’s claim Half True."
9,"The Green New Deal ""would do away with commercial air travel.""","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/06/andrew-yang/andrew-yang-revives-debunked-claim-about-green-new/,False,Andrew Yang,Andrew Yang revives debunked claim about Green New Deal killing air trave,"When asked about the Green New Deal during CNN’s climate change town hall, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said he embraced the plan, with one caveat: Its deadline for ending air travel is too tight, he said.
""The only issue I have with the Green New Deal is the timing of the timeline,"" Yang said. ""I mean, they are right that we need to take urgent action, but the timeline that they put out there would do away with commercial air travel and a lot of other things in a particular time frame, that, if we have a little bit more time, we can head in the same direction and achieve most of the same value.""
But Yang got his facts mixed up. The Green New Deal makes no mention of air travel, much less doing away with it.
Ending air travel not part of plan
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled a House version of the Green New Deal Feb. 7. In the Senate, Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey introduced a companion measure.
Broadly speaking, these resolutions express aspirations to curb climate change and protect the environment by investing in renewable energy and infrastructure, in a way that’s equitable and creates jobs. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution is nonbinding. 
The initial proposal was met with great fanfare among Democrats. The House version had 89 Democratic co-sponsors, and nearly a dozen Democratic senators — including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — sponsored their chamber’s version.
So what does the Green New Deal say about air travel? In a word, nothing. It makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail.""
Yang’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But his mixup may trace back to the Green New Deal’s sloppy rollout — which became the basis of the (mostly Republican) talking point about Democrats wanting to phase out commercial air travel.
Around the time of the Green New Deal’s unveiling, Ocasio-Cortez’s office released a frequently asked questions, or FAQ, as a supplement to the plan.
The document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.""
The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle.""
Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump, senators and conservative media outlets pounced on the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete.
Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake.
Fact-checkers at PolitiFact, the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have all debunked the claim. But as Yang’s statement shows, the notion persists.
Climate change experts say ending air travel not a goal
When we previously looked at this claim, experts on climate change told us it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight.
""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school.
Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances.
""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy.""
In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University.
""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel — that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House.
Our ruling
Yang said the Green New Deal ""would do away with commercial air travel.""
The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" His claim may trace back to a Republican talking point, based on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates.

9,"""70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries.""","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/06/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-blamed-3-industries-70-greenhouse/,Half-True,Elizabeth Warren,Elizabeth Warren blamed 3 industries for 70% of greenhouse gases. That muddles the picture,"Near the end of her turn on CNN’s climate change town-hall-a-thon, host Chris Cuomo asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren about lightbulbs. Specifically, if the government should be telling people the kind of lightbulbs they can have.
The Democratic presidential candidate cast the issue as a diversion from the real task at hand.
""This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about,"" Warren said. ""They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, straws and cheeseburgers, when 70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries.""
After the town hall, Warren repeated the 70% statistic on Instagram. 
         View this post on Instagram           The fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about light bulbs and cheeseburgers while 70% of pollution comes from just three industries. We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on. #ClimateTownHall A post shared by  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Sep 4, 2019 at 8:20pm PDT 
We wondered which three industries the Democratic presidential candidate had in mind.
Warren’s campaign directed us to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency’s page on the sources of greenhouse gas emissions shows that three sectors —transportation, electricity production and industry — account for 78% of the American total.
But those are activities, not industries in themselves. Transportation, the biggest of the three, includes the cars people drive and the flights they take for business and pleasure.
""It is strange, obviously, to say ‘three industries’ with one of them being ‘industry,’"" said the co-director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change John Reilly.

The focus on industry, Reilly said, shifts attention away from the broader ways that energy consumption is woven into the fabric of American life. 
""This may lead to the implication that the cost of reducing these emissions will fall on industry,"" he said. ""To the extent that myth is perpetuated, that is a problem. One way or another, we will all bear the cost of doing things differently."" 
The climate researchers we reached said Warren’s term was off the mark. Where they differed was on the significance. In contrast to Reilly, Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said he didn’t find it to be a major issue.
As it turns out, Warren has used the 70% figure in a couple of ways that are more accurate, without saying ""industries.""
Earlier during the town hall, Warren said she wanted to focus on ""the three areas where we get the most carbon pollution in America right now.""
""They're in our buildings and homes, right? What we're burning. It's our cars and light-duty trucks that we drive. And it's the generation of electricity where we're still using a lot of carbon-based fuel to make that happen."" 
Eliminating the carbon footprint in all three by 2035 would, she said, ""cut 70% of the carbon that we are currently spewing into the air.""
That’s a slightly different mix of sources, and based on the EPA numbers, they add up to the reduction Warren claimed.
In her $1 trillion clean energy plan that Warren posted a day before the town hall, she was fully accurate. 
""Electricity, transportation, buildings, and related commercial activity are responsible for nearly 70% of all U.S. carbon emissions,"" she wrote.
Our ruling
Warren said that three industries account for 70% of the carbon that goes into the air. That’s imprecise. It is accurate to say that transportation, producing electricity and industry writ large are the three largest sources of greenhouse gases and represent more than 70% of the problem. But those are activities, not industries. Individual Americans as well as companies contribute to the situation in ways that are often intertwined.
Warren herself has been more accurate in her energy plan and even during the town hall itself. But she pushed the focus on industry on social media, and climate change researchers say that word doesn’t fit with the 70% figure she used.
We rate this claim Half True."
9,Says actor Tim Allen wrote a lengthy anti-Democrat attack on Facebook.,"on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/06/facebook-posts/no-tim-allen-didnt-write-viral-anti-democrat-post-/,False,Facebook posts,"No, actor Tim Allen didn’t write that viral anti-Democrat post on Facebook | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","An extensive political tirade criticizing Democrats and liberals recently went viral on Facebook – and claims that actor and comedian Tim Allen wrote the whole thing. 
The nearly 500-word post includes numerous observations attributed to the actor and has gotten almost 5,000 shares since being posted Sept. 1.
The post features a photo of Allen with his alleged statement written as the caption. For the purposes of brevity, we will not post the entire passage attributed to Allen, but it begins: 
""Tim Allen is credited with writing this ... Here are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence, like moderate Democrats, Libertarians and Independents and the never Trump Republicans and those thinking of ‘walking away’ from the Democratic party … Women are upset at Trump’s naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray … Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems women’s rights only matter if those women are liberal … No Border Walls. No voter ID laws. Did you figure it out yet?.."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because there’s no evidence the actor actually said this.
Before we get to that, we want to note that we have fact-checked some of the claims made in the statement: 
No, House Democrats did not vote to allow noncitizens to vote as part of HR 1
Will Trump's border wall cost less than Obamacare website?

No, the Green New Deal doesn't aim to end air travel, as Florida Sen. Rick Scott says
Newt Gingrich misleading in saying Bill Clinton paid $850,000 'penalty' 
But as to whether Tim Allen – a Republican who has been open about his conservative viewpoints in interviews – actually said or wrote this, a review of all the available evidence indicates the answer is no. 
Not one media organization reported that Allen authored the post and the statement was not posted to any of Allen’s official social media accounts.
Claims that Allen said this began surfacing in late August 2019, when other fact-checking organizations came across similar posts. 
But it appears that days before social media posts began crediting Allen with the statement, a version of it was posted on the Facebook page of singer Ted Nugent, who is also known to be a vocal conservative.
A day later, the message was shared by a Facebook user who is coincidentally named Tim Allen, but is not the actor.
It is likely the actor was misattributed after another man with the same name shared it.

9,"""When two large whales do the nasty there’s sometimes this one bro who just sort of holds them up so they don’t float off.""","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/sep/06/viral-image/facts-whale-life-do-male-whales-help-other-males-m/,False,Viral image,The facts of whale life: Do male whales ‘help’ other males mate? | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Woe, to be a third wheel. Or a third whale. 
At least, a recent Facebook post equates the two. 
""Third whaling,"" says the Aug. 19 post, which features an illustration of two whales seemingly mating and a third underneath them. ""So apparently when two large whales do the nasty there’s sometimes this one bro who just sort of holds them up so they don’t float off. Nature is beautiful."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Nature is beautiful, but what’s happening here is a little less love, a little more war. 
""Good story!"" Scott Kraus, chief marine mammals scientist at the Anderson-Cabot Center for Ocean Life, said about the Facebook post. ""But entirely fictional. Why one male would help another secure a copulation? It makes no sense biologically to give up creating your genetically related offspring to help your buddy.""
Many observations of mating groups in right, bowhead and gray whales have led people to think males are helping one another to get the female, Kraus said. ""But it is mostly competition, pure and simple."" 
Quoting from the book ""Gray Whales"" by David G. Gordon and Alan Baldridge, a 2000 New York Times Q&A says that ""two courting bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios that remain intact right up to the moment of conception."" 
The idea that any extra males held the mating whales together to brace them has been ""mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation of what is going on in a process that is difficult to study,"" according to the Times.
Different whale species behave differently. The contests between male humpback whales can be violent, or deadly, according to a 2008 Smithsonian Magazine story, as male whales attack each other underwater vying for the female’s attention. 
In August 2000, meanwhile, a female North American Right whale was observed by scientists simultaneously having sex with two males. Kraus told us that when female whales remain with their blowholes upright and swimming forward, they may be ensuring that only males fit enough to keep up and hold their breath for long periods of time can mate with her. In right whales, he said, ""it’s likely that the female instigates this behavior by calling — the more males, the more competition, the more likely she is to get the best male.""
A 2015 video posted on YouTube by National Geographic shows gray whales the magazine says ""may be engaged in a ‘three way.’ ""
""It’s common to see two male gray whales courting a female,"" the text that appears over the video reads. ""They take turns attempting to mate with her. Body alignment is important in these 35-feet plus mammals. One male supports the female as the other attempts to mate with her.""
An accompanying article quotes a gray whale researcher saying: ""Many times gray whales do mating triads, and at times one male props the other male up to mate and then they flip flop positions."" 
These statements seem to support the Facebook post, but we wanted to know more. We reached out to Mark Girardeau, the wildlife photographer who used a drone to record the footage of the whales that National Geographic posted. He told us that the information in the New York Times Q&A that challenges the notion of a third ""helper"" whale is accurate.
""Many species have never even been documented mating, so we just don’t know,"" he said. ""Gray whales were previously thought to have only mated in threes for support, but I’ve also recently found out that it is just two males competing, and it’s just a matter of which bull’s semen does the job."" 
We asked Trevor Branch, a professor at the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, about the ""third whaling"" claims. 
""Sounds super unlikely,"" he told us in an email. ""Often there are two males competing to mate with the female, and it might appear (as) if one is below (and) that it’s supporting the mating couple."" 
He pointed us to a recent article in Marine Mammal Science that he notes was ""about this exact scenario in blue whales.""
The article says that escorting behavior, in which a male accompanies a female, is known to happen among animals including humpback whales, African elephants and some primate species.

""Rival males may challenge the escorting male to take his place… .

In an Instagram post published Sept. 2, one user published a screenshot of a tweet that claims the singer Rihanna has hired ""five planes that carried 90,000 liters of water to support the fire control"" in the Amazon rainforest. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research estimates there have been 90,000 fires throughout the region this year.
""We luv Rihanna,"" the Instagram user wrote about the artist. ""(Pretty sure it’s a joke but we still luv her)""
We don’t know if it’s a joke, but we do know it’s not true. The post, which has racked up thousands of Instagram likes and numerous shares, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

PolitiFact reached out to the Instagram user who shared the post, but we haven’t heard back. We also reached out to the public relations agency that represents Rihanna for more details. We’ll update this story if we hear back.
A search for the original tweet pictured in the Instagram post turned up several examples of the same claim, although with different celebrities. Over the past week, tweeters have claimed that Selena Gomez, rapper Bhad Bhabie, Nicki Minaj and other public figures have also hired five planes to carry 90,000 liters of water to the Amazon.
An advanced Twitter search of Rihanna’s tweets revealed that the artist has never tweeted about the Amazon rainforest. She also hasn’t mentioned the fires on her Instagram in the past several weeks.
Finally, we couldn’t find any news stories mentioning Rihanna even speaking about the Amazon fires, much less hiring planes to carry water there. It’s reasonable to assume a celebrity as well-known as Rihanna would receive at least some press attention for such a move. Rihanna’s foundation, for example, has been involved with other humanitarian efforts, such as giving grants to nonprofits for disaster relief.
But when it comes to this rainforest claim, we couldn’t find any evidence to support the notion that she or any of the other celebrities mentioned on Twitter had hired aircraft to help put out the Amazon fires. 
We do know, however, that the Brazilian military has used warplanes to dump water on the blazes.

9,"""Gov. Evers asked the director of WEDC to stay on""","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/06/alberta-darling/darling-whiffs-claim-about-evers-and-state-jobs-ag/,False,Alberta Darling,Darling whiffs on claim about Evers and state jobs agency | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Wisconsin’s economic development agency has been a lightning rod for years.
The public-private partnership — officially the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. — oversees grants and loans given to businesses in exchange for the creation of new jobs. It has drawn criticism for bad loans, failures to verify created jobs, negative state audits and most recently its role in bringing the Foxconn Technology Group plant to Racine County.
Gov. Tony Evers even pledged to de-fund the agency in his first budget, though he later backed down from that position (earning a Full Flop rating from us).
Now the relationship between Evers and WEDC has a new wrinkle.
Addressing the state Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, claimed the Democratic governor had developed quite an affinity for the Republican-appointed head of the agency.
""Our Gov. Evers asked the director of WEDC to stay on, because he was really concerned that the good trends that were happening with WEDC would not be able to continue with a really quick turnover,"" Darling, the committee’s co-chair, said at the Sept. 4, 2019, meeting. ""The director to his credit, stayed.""
Hmm.
Unraveling this seemingly simple claim takes us on a meandering path that includes lame-duck laws, appeals courts and resignations.
Let’s get started.
The background
This claim centers on Mark Hogan, a former banker appointed as CEO of WEDC in September 2015.
Hogan was named to the post by Gov. Scott Walker, who had the power to name a CEO with state Senate approval.
But after Evers defeated Walker in the November 2018 election, Republicans worried he would make good on his pledge to dissolve WEDC. A series of lame-duck bills finalized in December 2018 (while Republicans still controlled all of state government) included a temporary turnover of power: Republicans would oversee WEDC until Sept. 1, 2019.
Republicans said at the time they wanted to temporarily gain control to show Evers that WEDC works well and persuade him to keep it as is. Hogan said he did not seek the change.
Meanwhile, Hogan announced in June 2019 that he would be leaving the agency in fall 2019, which officials said he had previously told both Walker and Evers. In an Aug. 26 letter to Evers, Hogan revealed his last day would be Sept. 3.
Evers tweeted a thanks to the outgoing Hogan that day.
""Thank you ... for your leadership and service to our state,"" the governor said. ""I have appreciated you and your candor, collaboration, and dedication to our state. Sending you my sincerest respect and gratitude--Kathy and I wish you the very best in retirement.""
Breaking down the claim
The timeline doesn’t allow much space for Evers to extend Hogan's stay, since Hogan left the agency two days after Evers gained oversight power.
And Evers’ staff said no such request was made — in September or before.
""The law required us to keep him on. At no point did the governor ask Mark to stay on post-Sept. 1,"" Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said in an email. ""There was not a scenario when Mark said he planned to leave earlier and the governor asked him to stay. That never happened.""
So what is Darling talking about?
The complicating factors here are the court challenges to the lame-duck laws.
A Dane County judge struck down the laws and legislative confirmation of a slew of Walker’s last-minute appointments in March 2019, after which Evers withdrew 82 of those appointments. 
Reporter Scott Bauer of the Associated Press noted on Twitter that ruling also gave Evers power to appoint a new leader for WEDC. But Evers said he had no immediate plans to do so — and never took any such action.
An appeals court stayed the Dane County ruling six days later, restoring the lame-duck laws and returning WEDC oversight to Republicans until Sept. 1. Three other lawsuits over the lame-duck laws are ongoing, but for now at least most of the laws are in effect.
Defending Darling’s claim, spokesman Bob Delaporte pointed to Evers’ inaction in the wake of the court case and times the governor spoke positively of Hogan’s work and the relationship between the two.
""If the governor’s office never formally asked for Hogan to stay, they were at the very least pleased enough with his performance to never ask him to leave. The governor had an opportunity to make a change at WEDC and didn’t,"" Delaporte said in an email. ""I think it’s fair to assume that if you have the chance to remove someone from an agency and don’t you must like the performance and direction that person is providing.""
But that was not Darling’s claim. She claimed Evers asked him to stay on — and continue after the Sept. 1 changeover date. Darling’s office provided no evidence of that.
Our ruling
Darling told her legislative colleagues the governor asked Hogan to stay on as head of WEDC. 
Though Evers was mostly unable to address Hogan’s post before Sept. 1, court cases did create a brief window where he could have made a change.
But declining to make a change amid a contentious court battle is not the same thing as asking Hogan to stay on — which implies he intended to leave earlier. Hogan by all accounts simply informed both Evers and Walker that he planned to leave this fall, then did so.
We rate Darling’s claim False."
9,"""America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors.""","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/sep/06/samuel-sinyangwe/its-true-there-are-more-governors-who-have-worn-bl/,True,Samuel Sinyangwe,It’s true: There are more governors who have worn blackface than black governors | Pund,"An activist on Twitter posted an eye-popping statistic about the governors currently in office in the United States.
""America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors,"" said Samuel Sinyangwe, co-founder of Campaign Zero, an activist group focused on police violence, in a viral Aug. 30 tweet that was cited by anchor Chuck Todd of NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""
America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors. https://t.co/VHq1Cl4Xkl— Samuel Sinyangwe (@samswey) August 30, 2019 
This claim was easy to fact-check: There are zero black governors for the 50 states. But there are two governors who’ve apologized for wearing blackface. 
Sinyangwe’s tweet came on the heels of an Aug. 29 report that Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey had apologized after audio emerged of a 52-year-old radio interview in which she talked about wearing blackface for a student skit at Auburn University.
In February, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said he was one of two men pictured in a racist yearbook photograph from 1984, which showed one man dressed in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe. At the time, Northam did not say which costume he was wearing. But he later recanted his apology, saying neither man in the photograph was him. 
An investigation commissioned by Eastern Virginia Medical School, where Northam got his medical degree, did not conclude whether Northam was in the picture from its 1984 yearbook.
""With respect to the photograph on Gov. Northam’s personal page, we could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph,"" the final report said. ""The governor himself has made inconsistent public statements in this regard.""
When Northam said the investigation ""confirmed what I said all along, that I’m not in the picture,"" we rated his statement False.
Depending on whether you count Northam, there’s at least one governor — and possibly a second — who has owned up to wearing blackface in the past. 
Meanwhile, there are currently no black governors, according to Rutgers University’s Center on the American Governor. Out of 50 sitting governors, 47 are white, and the remaining three are Hispanic, Asian American and Native American.
Only two African Americans have been elected governor, with the most recent being Democrat Deval Patrick, who was voted into office in Massachusetts in 2006. Democrat Douglas Wilder had previously been elected as Virginia’s governor, a post he held from 1990 to 1994.
Before Wilder’s election, the only black governor had been P. B. S. Pinchback, who stepped in as Louisiana’s governor for 34 days in 1872 while the incumbent faced impeachment, according to CBS News. In 2008, Democrat David Paterson was also appointed governor of New York after Eliot Spitzer resigned.
Democrats Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Ben Jealous, all black, lost gubernatorial races in Georgia, Florida and Maryland in 2018.
""When a lot of African Americans start their political careers, they often run in places with large or growing African-American populations,"" said Andra Gillespie, professor of political science at Emory University. ""Given the fact that there is no state that has a majority black population, that presents a challenge.""
That’s why black candidates have been more successful getting elected as mayors of cities or members of Congress from urban districts with heavy black populations, said John Weingart, director of the Center on the American Governor.
""The two elected governors, certainly in the case of Deval Patrick, have been considered successful governors,"" he added. ""So it’s not like getting one in necessarily opens the door.""
There have still been plenty of predominantly white jurisdictions that have put black politicians in various offices, Gillespie said, but the ""historical norm"" is that black candidates fare better when black voters can get to the polls. For much of American history, that wasn’t possible.
""For nearly 100 years after black rights to vote were protected by the 15th Amendment, a number of the states in which African Americans lived came up with ingenious ways to prevent African Amerricans from being able to exercise their right to vote,"" Gillespie said. ""What that did was shut off an opportunity for blacks to be able to run for office.""
In an email to PolitiFact, Sinyangwe noted that the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Albert Bryan, is black. The U.S. Virgin Islands is a territory, not a state.
Our ruling
Sinyangwe said, ""America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors.""
There are currently no black governors in the United States. But there’s at least one, Ivey, who has admitted to wearing blackface in the past, and Northam has been accused of the same.

9,"The Amazon rainforest fires are ""directly related to trade"" tensions between the United States and China.","on Friday, September 6th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/06/john-delaney/trumps-trade-war-blame-amazon-wildfires-s-reach/,False,John Delaney,Is Trump’s trade war to blame for the Amazon wildfires? That’s a reach,"At first glance, U.S.-Chinese trade tensions may seem unrelated to the surge of wildfires in the Amazon rainforest. But one Democratic presidential candidate is linking the environmental devastation to President Donald Trump’s trade war with Beijing.
John Delaney’s argument is that tit-for-tat tariffs between the economic superpowers have decimated U.S. soybean exports to China. As a result, he said, farmers in Latin America are now incentivized to take extreme measures to feed their newly expanded Chinese market. 
""In reality, (the Amazon wildfires are) directly related to trade. The fact that U.S. farmers can't sell soybeans to China has created an opportunity for Brazil to sell soybeans to China,"" John Delaney said Aug. 27 on Fox News. ""As a result, farmers are tearing down the Amazon to grow soybeans.""
We found that while those two dots — the U.S.-Chinese trade war and Amazon wildfires — can be connected, Delaney exaggerated the link.  
Amazon fires 
Experts who study ancient environments say farmers have been burning the Amazon rainforest for millenia.
So why have this year’s fires have garnered so much attention? Because there haven’t been this many fires since 2012. 
More than 95,000 fires were ablaze in the Brazilian Amazon at last count, which represents a 59% increase from around this time last year, according to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. The number changes daily.
While this year is not on track to be record-breaking, the amount of fire is ""relatively high compared to recent years,"" Mikaela Weisse and Sarah Ruiz of the World Resource Institute wrote.
Environmental experts believe humans are responsible for the vast majority of these wildfires, intentionally or not
China turns to Brazil
So what’s that got to do with U.S.-Chinese trade relations?
Under Delaney’s logic, Trump’s trade war with China set in motion retaliatory tariffs against U.S. soybean farmers. And increasingly, Chinese soybean buyers have looked to farmers in Brazil, where Amazon lands could be used to cultivate the crop — even if it means burning rainforest to clear more arable land.  
The U.S. Soybean Export Council, a trade association, expects American soybean exports to China this year to be about one-third of last year.
At the same time, Brazil has replaced the United States as the biggest supplier of soybeans, according to the South China Morning Post.
While Brazil has been selling soybeans to China for years, the U.S.-Chinese trade war has been a welcomed development for Brazil’s soybean farmers.
""We are prepared to take advantage of the trade war to increase our business with China and further build trade relations,"" Igor Brandao, chief of the agribusiness division of Brazil’s trade promotion agency, told the South China Morning Post.   
Multiple causes
We reached out to experts from a variety of fields — economics, trade, politics, environmental sciences — who told is that no single factor alone is responsible for the uptick in Amazon wildfires this year.
While the U.S.-Chinese trade war is certainly one factor, it should not be given the most weight, some experts told us. The more direct cause lies with decisions by Brazil’s political and business leaders. 
South American farmers and ranchers have long sought more Amazon lands to raise cattle and grow crops. In countries where the Amazon lies — Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru — there are laws against deforestation, but enforcement has been inconsistent.   
While previous Brazilian presidents have exercised relatively tighter control over the rainforest, the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office at the start of 2019, has taken a more hands-off approach in order to encourage more agricultural activity and development.
Some experts we spoke to said this was the true spark — not strained U.S.-Chinese trade relations.
""The main economic reason for the fires is pent-up demand — under previous Brazilian presidents — for new acreage for cattle and crops,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which supports free trade. ""The Bolsonaro government relaxed controls and the burning escalated.
""While I deplore Trump’s trade war,"" he said, ""I think the tie to Amazon fires is remote.""
A National Geographic analysis of data from the Global Fire Emissions Database also concluded that the uptick in fires is a result of the Bolsonaro administration’s laxer regulation.
""In Brazil — which controls the majority of the vast forest — regulations were put into place over a decade ago to curb the expanse of deforestation,"" National Geographic reported. ""But these rules have been loosened by the new Brazilian administration, and consequently fires are spiking.""
Delaney’s campaign pointed us to a number of press reports that drew a connection between Trump’s trade war with China and the burning Amazon rainforests. 
The Trump administration's trade war with China has ""provided some economic incentive to clear the Amazon forests via fire,"" said Ross Burkhart, a political science professor at Boise State University who specializes in environmental policy. But he added that any connection is an indirect one, and somewhat beside the main point.  
""Focusing on that impact takes away from the more direct causal factors,"" he said, ""which in my view involve internal decisions made by Brazilian agricultural, business, and political leaders.""
Our ruling
Delaney said the Amazon rainforest fires are ""directly related to trade"" tensions between the United States and China.
U.S.-Chinese trade tensions have expanded South American farmers’ opportunity to sell soybeans in China, which in turn has created an economic incentive to burn Amazon land so it can be used for crop production. But a more direct cause of the surge in wildfires is the loosening of deforestation rules under the current Brazilian government that favor the country’s agricultural and business interests.

9,"Originally ""almost all models predicted"" Dorian would hit Alabama.","on Thursday, September 5th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/05/donald-trump/trump-said-almost-all-models-predicted-dorian-woul/,Pants on Fire!,Donald Trump,Trump said ‘almost all models predicted’ Dorian would hit Alabama. He’s wrong,"Armed with spaghetti models and a Sharpie-doctored map, President Donald Trump defended his efforts to declare that once upon a time, Alabama was poised to face Hurricane Dorian’s wrath.
He even went so far as to say that there was a 95% chance that Alabama was on the hurricane’s path.
But Trump’s receipts don’t check out. This is the story of how the president mangled government models of the storm to blow the forecast way out of proportion and misinform Americans. 
The White House did not answer our questions
But by the end of the day the White House issued a statement by Rear Admiral Peter J. Brown, Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, who defended Trump. Brown said that he shared with Trump the spaghetti models that showed possible storm impacts outside the official forecast cone and that forecasts showed the possibility of tropical storm force winds hitting Alabama.
Doubling down on Alabama’s overblown risk
Over several days, Trump heard criticism from the media and meteorologists about his weekend warnings that even Alabama would ""get a piece of"" Dorian or ""will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.""
So, as he briefed reporters on the latest updates Sept. 4, he asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan to display a chart of the ""original"" forecast. 
#Sharpiegate was born: The hurricane’s cone had been extended in black ink to include a section of southeast Alabama, even though it didn’t match anything produced by the government’s hurricane forecasters. 
Speaking again to reporters Sept. 4, Trump said he ""didn’t know"" who altered the map. Trump also had this to say, alluding to yet another model that he thought would prove his point: 
""I know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go — actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be presented, where we had many lines going directly — many models — each line being a model.  And they were going directly through. And, in all cases, Alabama was hit — if not lightly, in some cases pretty hard. Georgia, Alabama — it was a different route. They actually gave that a 95% chance probability.""
Forecasters did not give Alabama a 95% chance of being hit, and the ""better map"" Trump shared hours later in a tweet also did not show most models hitting Alabama.
Case not closed
Trump’s tweet showed an Aug. 28 model of spaghetti plots for the hurricane’s path appearing in countless jiggly lines aimed at the southeastern United States.
""This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!""

The spaghetti plots show various models up to 10 days out and requires professional interpretation. The National Hurricane Center examines those models and then comes up with a five-day forecast. 
""The 'spaghetti tracks' from the forecast model are useful for hurricane forecasters to consider,"" said Judith Curry, an atmospheric scientist and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network. ""But they are easily misinterpreted by the public.""
And apparently, the president.
""There was absolutely not ever a 95% chance that Alabama would get hit, let alone ‘pretty hard’ or ‘in all cases,’"" said Brian McNoldy, a tropical cyclone researcher at the University of Miami who has been critical of Trump’s statements about Hurricane Dorian and other topics. 
A spaghetti plot shows multiple computer models that predict a storm’s path up to 10 days. There are about 100 models from various sources including the government and private firms. Some meteorologists only pay attention to some of them. The key is not to pluck out a particular strand but to look for consensus and watch the trend over time.
While the graphic Trump tweeted did show a few lines going through Alabama, McNoldy said the lines ""are not all equals and should not be interpreted as such.""
""Even so, only a small handful were there, hardly a 95% chance or ‘in all cases,’ "" he said.
The fine print of the graphic says ""If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.""
As for Trump’s potentially Sharpied cone map, that also looks like a case of exaggerating one of many five-day forecasts. 
One map from Aug. 30 showed the outer edge of the five-day cone just barely nipping the southeast corner of Alabama. Most from around that time showed the cone centered over Florida and the southeast Atlantic coast.
The edge of the cone represents a two-thirds probability of the center of the storm tracking within it, using average track errors from the previous five years, McNoldy said.
By the weekend, there was growing consensus that Hurricane Dorian would turn north before it eventually reached Florida, Curry said.
""There was never a substantial probability of it reaching Alabama,"" she said.
There was a period of time when the Gulf really was threatened in the extended range beyond five days, said Keith G. Blackwell and Andrew Murray, two University of South Alabama meteorologists. 
But the five-day forecasts from the National Hurricane Center focused on Florida and then the southeastern coast days before Trump started on Alabama. (Trump has since highlighted an Alabama National Guard warning on Twitter about the storm forecast. The view was not shared by the meteorologists we reached.)
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s advisory showing tropical storm force wind probabilities did show at certain points a chance that Alabama would face strong winds over the next few days. For example, a 2 p.m. Aug. 30 update showed anywhere from a 5 to 30% chance that Alabama would face winds at 39 miles per hour.
Ultimately, there was a very small chance that Dorian could have reached Alabama, but Trump overstated what earlier predictions showed.
""In no way was Alabama a likely target, but there was a small chance that Dorian could have entered the Gulf of Mexico,"" Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach said. ""But, I think the key point is that NOAA never discussed that scenario, because it was likely at least one week out from when this guidance was available.""
Our ruling
Trump tweeted that originally ""almost all models predicted"" Dorian would hit Alabama.
He linked to a spaghetti models map that showed various models through the next 10 days. While some of those models showed Dorian hitting Alabama, Trump has grossly overstated what it showed.
The National Hurricane Center takes these models and then comes up with a five-day forecast. It’s ridiculous for him to use the models to conclude that it showed almost all predicted the storm would hit Alabama, which matches our definition of Pants on Fire."
9,"Referring to the Iraq War, ""immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment.""","on Thursday, September 5th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/05/joe-biden/oe-biden-falsely-claims-he-immediately-opposed-ira/,False,Joe Biden,Joe Biden falsely claims that he immediately opposed Iraq War,"Joe Biden continues to defend his record on the Iraq War as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination, lately claiming he opposed the war the moment it started.
In an NPR interview aired Sept. 3, host Asma Khalid asked Biden to respond to criticism about the Iraq War, particularly sending troops into the country.
""I let my record stand. I think my record has been good. I think the vast majority of the foreign policy community thinks it's been very good. For example, I got a commitment from President Bush he was not going to go to war in Iraq. He looked me in the eye in the Oval Office; he said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program,"" Biden said.
""He got them in, and before we know it, we had a shock and awe. Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment,"" Biden continued. ""Now, the judgment of my trusting the president to keep his word on something like that, that was a mistake. And I apologize for that.""
Is it true that Biden immediately came out against the war the moment it started? No.
Biden’s recounting of his position doesn’t match the public comments he made right before and after the war started. During that time, Biden acknowledged frustrations with how the United States was heading into war, but said he supported the president. Biden for years stood by his vote for a resolution that paved the way for the war, even though he also criticized the Bush administration’s strategy — saying the United States went to war too soon, without enough troops, and without enough countries supporting the effort.
Path to Iraq War
In 2002, President George W. Bush argued that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace.
In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq.
In a Senate floor speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that ""failure to overwhelmingly support"" the resolution was ""likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur."" The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said.
Biden left open the possibility that Hussein might ""miscalculate"" and ""misjudge"" U.S. resolve. In that event, Biden said, use of military force might be needed, with the support of others, or alone if it came to that.
""If it comes to war,"" Biden said, ""the president, I am confident, will go to the American people. In a speech last week he made a compelling case that Iraq's failure to disarm is our problem as well as the world's. But as I said, he has not yet made the case to the American people that the United States may have to solve this problem alone or with relatively few people or has he told us of the sacrifices that such a course of action will involve. I am confident that he will do so if and when it proves necessary.""
The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found.
CNN interviewed Biden on March 19, 2003, as U.S.-led troops pushed closer to the Iraqi border. Then-CNN anchor Judy Woodruff asked Biden if Senate Democratic Minority Leader Tom Daschle had gone ""over the line"" by saying that he regretted that one life would be lost because Bush failed at diplomacy.
""No, I think what you saw is a sense of frustration,"" Biden said, adding that the frustration related to ""the lost opportunities of maybe being able to do this with others, maybe, if we had others with us, not even having to go to war.""
Woodruff also pressed Biden on comments by other Democratic lawmakers who said they supported the troops, but reserved the right to criticize Bush.
""I support the president. I support the troops. We should make no distinction,"" Biden said. ""We should have one voice going out to the whole world that we're together. There's plenty to criticize this president for. Let's get this war done.""
Biden also said that at a caucus meeting that day, his suggestion was to send a message that ""when that first tank crosses that line, we should be on the floor of the United States Senate and every capital in the world hear one voice from both parties, saying, we support the troops. We support the president. And this is the single most important thing we do, and show it by our actions.""
 So despite frustrations on how the United States was going into war, lawmakers should ultimately support the president, Biden said.
Biden’s comments after the war started
A week after the war started, Biden in a Senate floor statement said he supported a concurrent resolution that expressed the United States’ gratitude to other nations who were supporting the United States in disarming Iraq. 
""God willing, this war will continue to go well... casualties on all sides will be few... and victory will be swift,"" Biden said March 27, 2003. ""And working with the international community, we will put Iraq on the path to a pluralistic and democratic society.""
At a Brookings Institution event in July 2003, about four months after the Iraq started, Biden embraced his vote, but also criticized the Bush administration. 
""Nine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force, and I would vote that way again today,"" Biden said.
Biden said it was the correct vote because Hussein for more than a decade had defied U.N. security resolutions, failed to account for huge gaps in weapons declarations documented by U.N. weapons inspectors, and refused to abide by conditions set for him.
Still, the Bush administration erred in its approach to Hussein, Biden added. 
""For me, the issue was never whether we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam,"" Biden said July 2003. ""And it's precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we're paying the price for it now.""
Biden in a 2004 op-ed again justified his vote and cast blame on the Bush administration’s actions.
Authorizing use of force ""made sense,"" Biden wrote, because Hussein had ""spent a decade playing cat and mouse with the U.N. inspectors sent to verify his compliance with the Security Council's demands.""
""I've asked myself many times whether there is more Congress could and should have done to slow the rush to war, even after we authorized the use of force, but the truth is that many of us repeatedly warned the administration about the mistakes it was making,"" Biden added.
In a November 2005 interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Biden was asked if his 2002 vote was a mistake.
""It was a mistake,"" Biden said. ""It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.""
Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said that Biden as senator called for investigation of the Bush administration’s ""intelligence failures and blasted their abandonment of diplomacy and extremely flawed prosecution of the war.""
""He worked in good faith with the Bush administration to ensure that the United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq could resume, which is why he voted yes,"" Bates said. ""However, his good faith was not reciprocated and even once inspections were back on track the Bush administration plunged the nation into war.""
Our ruling
Referring to the Iraq War, Biden said, ""immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment.""
That’s not the case. The public record shows that immediately before and after the United States invaded Iraq in March 2003, Biden supported the president. He also on multiple occasions for years justified his vote on a resolution that authorized the use of force against Iraq.
Biden lamented that the United States did not have the support of more nations and gradually criticized the Bush administration’s strategy. But his claim of an ""immediate"" opposition to the war isn’t accurate.
We rate his statement False."

Text above the image on Facebook reads:
""In 1789, being a member of Congress in the U.S. was considered a civic duty, and they were only paid 50 cents a day. When adjusted for inflation, the yearly salary for a member of Congress was only about $5,000 a year in today’s dollars.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The claim is not accurate. Senators and representatives of the first U.S. Congress received more than 50 cents a day. 
According to the Senate’s historical list of salaries, senators made $6 a day in 1789. The same figure can be found on the U.S. House list, as well.
The $6 per diem is reflected in a report by the Congressional Research Service, too. According to congressional session archives, the first session of Congress in 1789 lasted 168 days. If members were paid $6 for each of those days, they made $1,008 from March 4 to Sept. 29, 1789.
When it comes to calculating what that amount would translate to in today’s dollars, it’s a bit more complicated. That’s because there are no official inflation numbers going that far back. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI inflation calculator only goes back to 1913. 
This post undershoots how much members of the first U.S Congress were paid and there is no official source for translating 1789 U.S. currency into today’s dollars.

Actors Debra Messing and Eric McCormack had called for The Hollywood Reporter to publish a list of people going to the Sept. 17 fundraiser for Trump in Beverly Hills.
""Hey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don’t wanna work with,"" McCormack tweeted Aug. 30.

Please print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI— Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) August 31, 2019 
In her rebuke, Goldberg compared the tweets to the Hollywood blacklists that sought to weed out communist sympathizers from the film industry in the mid 1900s.
""The last time people did this, people ended up killing themselves,"" she said during the show’s season premiere. ""This is not a good idea, OK? Your idea of who you don’t want to work with is your personal business.""
""Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on, and then people will be coming after you,"" she added.
Then, Goldberg gave this history lesson:
""We had something called a blacklist, and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff. Nobody cared whether it was true or not. They were accused, and they lost their right to work ... Think about it. Read about it. Remember what the blacklist actually meant to people and don’t encourage anyone, anyone, to do it.""
We thought some viewers might not know what Goldberg was talking about, so we contacted a few expert historians to fill in the gaps. They said her account was pretty much spot-on.
The original Hollywood blacklist
The blacklist Goldberg mentioned took place during the 1940s and 1950s, as the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union heated up.
This era — known in the history books as the ""Red Scare"" — was defined by an anti-communist crusade led by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who targeted federal government employees suspected of harboring communist beliefs. 
But it wasn’t McCarthy who initiated the Hollywood blacklist.
In October 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee, called HUAC, launched an investigation into the Hollywood film industry, which anti-communist lawmakers worried was pushing communist propaganda. It ended up subpoenaing more than 40 industry figures. 
Many of the names came from a series of columns written by the publisher and founder of the Hollywood Reporter that identified communists and communist sympathizers, according to the magazine, which looked back at its own role in a 2012 report.
A group of screenwriters and directors later known as the ""Hollywood 10"" denounced the investigation as a violation of their constitutional rights. For their trouble, they were cited for contempt of Congress, tried and found guilty. Each spent a year in jail and paid a $1,000 fine.
They were also blacklisted by studio executives. Eric Johnston, then the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a press release that the association’s members would not re-employ the Hollywood 10 and would not knowingly hire other communists.
The House committee probe was the ""starting gun for the Hollywood blacklist,"" said Thomas Doherty, professor of American studies at Brandeis University. ""It spurred the MPAA to issue its infamous Waldorf Statement in November 1947 saying the studios would not hire communists.""
As the committee continued its investigations through the 1950s, the blacklist grew to include about 325 screenwriters, actors and directors, before ending in the 1960s, according to History.com. 
Recent reports are mixed as to how many blacklisted workers were actually Communist party members or sympathizers and how many were merely accused, but according to History.com, the Hollywood 10 were ""admitted communists.""
""Various groups and individuals, almost all deeply rightwing, were involved in calling for a blacklist and naming the ‘guilty,’ but acceptance of that guilt by the liberal mainstream was widespread until the later 1950s,"" said Peter Buhle, retired senior lecturer at Brown University.
Some people dealt with the blacklist by moving abroad or writing scripts under pseudonyms or in the name of others. But most had trouble keeping their careers.
""For the majority of those blacklisted, there was no career rehabilitation, their lives were ruined,"" Buhle said. 
Doherty noted that actor Philip Loeb killed himself in 1955 after being blacklisted off his TV show ""The Goldbergs"" in 1951, and he said a number of other actors suffered premature deaths that are ""often considered to have been precipitated by the stress of the blacklist.""
""Whoopi is dead on,"" Doherty said, adding that the talk show host’s comparison between the 1950s Hollywood blacklist and the tweets from Messing and McCormack seems apt.
""There is an unpleasant parallel,"" he said. ""In both cases, people are being targeted — and threatened with career consequences — for an unpopular political belief.""
Trump weighed in on Messing’s tweet twice on Twitter, writing that the actress is ""in hot water"" and ""being accused of McCarthyism"" before suggesting that she should be fired.
Bad “actress” Debra The Mess Messing is in hot water. She wants to create a “Blacklist” of Trump supporters, & is being accused of McCarthyism. Is also being accused of being a Racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness. If Roseanne Barr....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019 
Our ruling
Goldberg said, ""The last time people (created a Hollywood blacklist), people ended up killing themselves … They were accused, and they lost their right to work.""
Experts on the original Hollywood blacklist said Goldberg’s account, while lacking specific details, was accurate. So we rate her statement True."

In a Facebook post published Sept. 3, one user claimed a photo depicted Dorian over the Bahamas the day before. A large swirl of clouds appears on the horizon, beyond beachfront condos and high-rises.
""Frightening yet hauntingly beautiful,"" reads the post, which has been shared more than 700 times. ""Hurricane Dorian over the Bahamas as it arrived yesterday.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it’s one of several suspect photos related to Dorian that has been shared this week, so we wanted to check it out.
The photo isn’t a real image at all — it’s at least two different images stitched together.
A reverse image search for the photo led us to a Reddit post from April 28. A user claimed the same photo that was shared on Facebook depicted Miami. Several Redditors commented that they thought it looked photoshopped. 
RELATED: Hurricanes and tropical storms lead to flood of misinformation
Using FotoForensics, a visual analysis tool, we were able to locate two distinct halves of the image: the foreground (with the oceanside buildings) and the background (the looming storm). The tool indicates that the buildings were digitally inserted into the storm photo.
Where are those buildings actually located? To answer that, we turned to Google Earth.
In the lower half of the doctored image, there is an ocean on the left, buildings in the center-left, an inlet in the center-right and more land on the right. The inlet has at least two islands in it.
On Google Earth, we looked at Miami Beach for these features, since it was mentioned on Reddit. After some scrolling up and down the coast, we found the spot where the foreground of the altered image seems to have been taken: North Miami Beach.
Snopes reported Sept. 3 that the clouds come from a May 2016 photo of a supercell thunderstorm in Kansas. The North Beach image is a stock photo.
But who made the altered version?
In a fact-check published Sept. 4, the Associated Press talked to artist Brent Shavnore, who originally published the image on his Instagram page April 12. He told the AP that he makes YouTube tutorials about how to create digital art like the altered photo of Miami Beach.

10,"Says that as vice president, he pinned a Silver Star on a Navy captain in Afghanistan who had carried a mortally wounded comrade out of a ravine, and resisted receiving a medal for his actions.","on Wednesday, September 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/04/joe-biden/facts-behind-joe-bidens-blended-story-battlefield-/,Mostly False,Joe Biden,The facts behind Joe Biden’s blended story of battlefield heroism,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has been taken to task for blending the stories of several soldiers into a single compelling narrative.
In August, the Washington Post uncovered discrepancies and inaccuracies in tales of military heroism Biden has told in several speeches since 2016. The most recent came at an August campaign stop in Hanover, N.H., that focused on health care. At the event, Biden highlighted the needs of veterans, especially those with post traumatic stress disorder. 
The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that they had no objection to the facts of the events reported by the Post, though they said the article leaves out or downplays what they consider relevant context.
Biden told the NPR Politics podcast on Sept. 3 that his mix-up of the details ""has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a health care policy.""
""The details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,"" Biden told NPR.
At PolitiFact, details do matter. Here are the facts of the underlying battlefield events, and how Biden strayed from them.
What Biden said in New Hampshire
At the Hanover event, Biden spoke of the need to overcome the military ethos of keeping personal pain inside. Soldiers, he said, need to know they can and should seek help.
""I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan 30 times. I’ve pinned medals, Silver Stars, on soldiers up in the Upper Konar Valley, in the middle of a firestorm, the poor guys have gone through. Young Navy captain — Navy, Navy — up in the mountains in the Konar Valley of Afghanistan. They’re behind, it’s called a FOB, a forward operating base, behind these great big barriers on top of a mountain in a little cove in a Godforsaken country. 
""One of his buddies got shot. Fell down a ravine about 60 feet. A four-star general asked me, would I go up into the FOB. Everybody got concerned. A vice president going up in the middle of this. But we can lose a vice president. We can’t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.
""This guy climbed down a ravine. Carried this guy up on his back under fire. And the general wanted me to pin the Silver Star on him. 
""I got up there. And standing —  it’s the God’s truth, my word as a Biden — he stood at attention. I went to pin him, he said, ‘Sir, I don’t want the damn thing. Do not pin it on me, sir. Please. Sir. Do not do that. He died. He died.’
""Same way in the middle of Fallujah. These kids are amazing.""
Biden might have cast this as ""God’s truth,"" but it wasn’t. His story in Hanover melded aspects of three real events into one hybrid narrative.

First actual event: Rejecting a medal
The emotional core of Biden’s story is the soldier telling him he did not want the medal. The closest match is the story of a Bronze Star Biden pinned on U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman in 2011 in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. The ceremony took place at Forward Operating Base Airborne in eastern Afghanistan.
Workman did not retrieve a wounded soldier from a ravine. Rather, he tried to rescue a friend from a burning Humvee, but he arrived too late.
""I never pulled him out because he was melting,"" Workman told the Post.
He confirmed to the newspaper that he did not look forward to the ceremony with Biden: ""I tried to get out of going,"" Workman said. ""I didn’t want that medal.""
In recounting the episode in a National Geographic 2016 interview, Biden gave this version of what Workman said right before receiving the medal: ""Sir, I don’t want it. I don’t want it. He died. He died. I didn’t do my job, sir. He died.""
Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said this is the essential truth of Biden’s story.
""In Afghanistan, he was moved by Staff Sgt. Workman's valor and selflessness, which is emblematic of the duty and sacrifice of the 9/11 generation of veterans who have given so much across countless deployments,"" Bates said.
PolitiFact’s attempt to reach Workman through military press officials was unsuccessful. The Biden campaign said they had no differences with what Workman told the Post.
Second actual event: Heroism in Konar Province
While visiting Afghanistan in 2008 with other senators, Biden witnessed an award ceremony in Konar Province. 

Then-Sens. Joe Biden, John Kerry, and Chuck Hagel photographed on a trip to  Afghanistan on Feb. 20, 2008. (State Department)
In 2007, during a firefight with the Taliban, a bullet cut through the jaw and neck of a soldier manning a hilltop machine gun. Under fire, Army Pfc. Miles Foltz got to his friend, pulled him to safety, stopped the bleeding and saved his life.
During Biden’s trip, he watched as Maj. Gen. David Rodriguez pinned the Bronze Star on Foltz.
Third actual event: Heroism on a hillside
In 2014, President Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military recognition, to Army Sgt. Kyle White. Biden was not present at the ceremony.
In 2007, White and 13 other members of his squad and an Afghan unit were making their way up a hill alongside a cliff when they were caught in an ambush.
""The platoon returned fire,"" Obama said in the White House award ceremony. ""Kyle quickly emptied a full magazine, but as he went to load a second, an enemy grenade exploded and knocked him unconscious.  He came to with his face pressed against a rock.""

Former Army Sgt. Kyle Jerome White receives the Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama on May 13, 2014. (U.S. Army)
Several of the other soldiers slid down the cliff to safety, but White saw Spc. Kain Schilling burrowed down behind a small tree, trying to treat a shattered arm.
""Kyle sprinted through enemy fire to Kain’s side and began applying a tourniquet — shielding Kain with his own body as gunfire shredded that tree,"" Obama said.
White aided a second wounded soldier on that hillside and, with bullets whizzing past, pulled him to shelter. That soldier didn’t survive, but the first one did.
After the ceremony, White showed reporters a metal bracelet on his wrist.
""It was given to me by another survivor of the 9 November ambush. He wears an identical one,"" White said. ""This has made it even more precious than the medal of symbol just placed around my neck. On it are the names of six fallen brothers; they are my heroes.""

History of jumbled events
Biden has told similar stories in the past, but with variations.
For instance, during a visit to Australia as vice president on July 17, 2016, Biden recalled pinning a Silver Star on a Navy captain at a ""forward operating base up in the valley."" 
The captain, Biden said, was ""a kid who jumped off the edge of a mountain where this FOB was, with only six people defending it, climbed down about 200 feet, put a kid on his back who had been wounded, carried him back up under gunfire, but 10 hours later, he died.""
When Biden went to pin the medal on the captain, Biden recalled, ""He said, sir, with all due respect, sir, I do not want it.""
This version wraps together elements of Foltz’s story (Biden was present at his pinning), White’s story (heroism alongside a cliff), and Workman’s story (the wish not to receive the medal). This version also garbles a few elements (it was a Bronze Star, not a Silver Star.

Then-Vice President Joe Biden joined Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander at a campaign rally in St. Louis, Missouri. (C-SPAN screenshot)
Later that year, while stumping for U.S. Senate candidate Jason Kander, Biden told yet another version. He referenced both the cliffside heroism and the burning Humvee, suggesting that both medal recipients tried to refuse the medal, saying they didn’t deserve it. 
""This is the God’s truth,"" Biden said at one point in his retelling.
Our ruling
Biden said that as vice president, he pinned a Silver Star on a Navy Captain in Afghanistan. Biden said the soldier pulled a mortally wounded comrade out of a ravine, and later resisted receiving a medal.
Biden did pin a medal on a soldier who felt he didn’t deserve a medal, and it was in Afghanistan. From there, several details are wrong: The soldier tried to rescue a comrade from a burning Humvee, not off the slope of a ravine. He was an Army specialist, not a Navy captain. Biden was a senator, not vice president. The medal was a Bronze Star, not a Silver Star.
The emotional element of a soldier who feels his medal is unwarranted is accurate. But Biden embellished the tale with details to give the story an unimpeachable ring of truth, and the facts don’t back that up. We rate this Mostly False."
10,"""From 2010 to 2017, natural gas production plummeted by nearly 70 percent in New York, but it soared almost 1,000 percent in Pennsylvania.""","on Wednesday, September 4th, 2019",http://politifact.com/new-york/statements/2019/sep/04/donald-trump/trump-correct-about-natural-gas-trends-new-york-an/,Mostly True,Donald Trump,Trump correct about natural gas trends in New York and Pennsylvania | PolitiFact New York,"President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of New York during a recent speech in Pennsylvania about energy and manufacturing. 
 ""From 2010 to 2017, natural gas production plummeted by nearly 70 percent in New York, but it soared almost 1,000 percent in Pennsylvania,"" Trump said at the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. ""And New York won't allow us to build a pipeline across because New York is sort of a long state and we can't have pipelines going across, helping a region that's not a wealthy region at all.""
Trump has criticized New York and its elected leadership many times in the past, and we wondered if his latest claim about natural gas production in New York and Pennsylvania was accurate.
We turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy, for statistics about natural gas production in New York and Pennsylvania. The administration collects, analyzes and publishes ""independent and impartial energy information,"" according to its website. 
In New York, natural gas production totaled 35.8 billion cubic feet in 2010 and 11.4 billion cubic feet in 2017. That’s a 68 percent decrease.
In Pennsylvania, production in 2010 totaled 572.9 billion cubic feet. By 2017, production totaled 5.5 trillion cubic feet, according to the administration. That’s an increase of 854 percent, when unrounded numbers are used.
In addition to researching the federal energy data repository, we researched natural gas production data in each state, and found similar results.   
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation provided similar statistics for 2010 and 2017, and it calculated that production fell by 66 percent. 
In Pennsylvania, the dramatic increase in natural gas production can be attributed to ""unconventional"" wells, or wells that are drilled deep into shale formations through a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania began in 2004, according to the state. The Marcellus Shale, which generally lies under parts of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia, is currently the ""most prolific natural gas area in the United States,"" according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
In 2017, Pennsylvania recorded 5.36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was produced from unconventional wells, which at the time was the largest natural gas production figure on record, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. 
Natural gas production from these unconventional wells grew by 1,360 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to  Elizabeth Rementer, the Department of Environmental Protection press secretary. Rementer also confirmed that the calculation of an increase in 854 percent of total natural gas production between 2010 and 2017, taken from federally collected data, is accurate. 
The dramatically different trends in natural gas production in each state can be tied to their different response to hydraulic fracturing. While Pennsylvania has seen significant growth in this kind of production, making it the second-largest producer in the country, behind Texas, New York, citing health risks associated with the practice, banned this kind of natural gas extraction in 2014. 
While New York has ""one of the most energy-efficient economies in the nation,"" it relies on other states, including Pennsylvania, and Canada, for most of its natural gas needs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Trump also referenced a pipeline across New York state. He could have been referring to a decision New York regulators made in May to deny a new natural gas pipeline, citing concerns about water quality. The pipeline would have connected natural gas fields in Pennsylvania with New Jersey and New York. Press officers at the White House did not respond to our request for information. 
Our ruling
President Trump said between 2010 and 2017, natural gas production in New York fell by nearly 70 percent, while production in Pennsylvania grew by nearly 1,000 percent.  
In Pennsylvania, total natural gas production grew by 854 percent between 2010 and 2017.
In New York, total natural gas production fell by between 66 and 68 percent. 
Trump’s statement was mostly accurate, but there’s enough difference between 854 percent and nearly 1,000 percent to warrant a Mostly True ruling."

""BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian,"" reads the photo’s caption.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it’s been shared hundreds of times by several users, so we wanted to check it out.
Turns out, it’s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes.
RELATED: Hurricanes and tropical storms lead to flood of misinformation
Snopes debunked it in October 2017. In its fact-check, Snopes wrote that rumors claiming Cinderella Castle can be partially or fully deconstructed during hurricanes go back as far as 1997, when the Chicago Tribune wrote about them as one of ""25 Secrets of the Magic Kingdom.""
""According to imagineers involved in its construction, Cinderella Castle was built to code to withstand hurricane-force winds and can in no way be disassembled,"" the newspaper wrote at the time, without naming any sources.
In a Sept. 4 email to PolitiFact, Disney World said it was not dismantling the castle in preparation for Dorian.
As for the photo we found on Facebook, there’s evidence that it was digitally altered to make it look like a castle spire is being removed by a crane.
Using a reverse image search, we found the exact same photo of Cinderella Castle published on Twitter in the lead-up to Hurricane Michael last year. We also found a very similar image published in a blog post in 2009 — but with the spire intact. The crane in the photo was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights.

(Right, image from the blog DIS Unplugged. Left, the altered version.)

The Aug. 28 Facebook post features a photo of Churchill alongside text that reads:
""You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life. -Winston Churchill""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This quote does not belong to Churchill. It could not be found on the International Churchill Society’s website or in the Churchill Archive, which contains more than 800,000 pages of original documents. It is also included in the running list of ""All the ‘Quotes’ Winston Churchill Never Said"" by Richard Langworth, senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project.
David Freeman, director of publications at the International Churchill Society, told PolitiFact the quote is commonly misattributed to Churchill. 
""It’s a common red herring,"" Freeman wrote in an email. ""Churchill never said it.""
The statement stems from an essay written by Victor Hugo some 30 years before Churchill was born.
The quote is a modernized variation of a passage Hugo wrote in his 1845 essay ""Villemain:"" 
""You have enemies? Why, it is the story of every man who has done a great deed or created a new idea. It is the cloud which thunders around everything that shines. Fame must have enemies, as light must have gnats. Do not bother yourself about it; disdain. Keep your mind serene as you keep your life clear.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post quotes Winston Churchill as once saying that having enemies is good because ""that means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.""
The original version of the quote actually came from Victor Hugo in 1845, not Churchill.

10,Say Gov. Tony Evers ‘canceled’ the sales tax holiday this year,"on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/sep/03/wisconsin-assembly-republicans/no-evers-did-not-cancel-sales-tax-holiday/,False,Wisconsin Assembly Republicans,"No, Evers did not ‘cancel’ the sales tax holiday | PolitiFact Wisconsin","Back-to-school shopping was a smidge more expensive in Wisconsin this year.
Wisconsin Republicans set up a sales tax holiday in 2018, giving consumers a pass for many categories of clothing, computers and school supplies. There was no such holiday in 2019.
And since there’s change, there must be blame.
In posts on Twitter and Facebook, the Wisconsin Assembly GOP pointed the finger at the state’s new Democratic governor.
""Last year, Republicans gave part of Wisconsin's budget surplus back to the taxpayers by instituting a sales tax holiday on some back-to-school items,"" the Aug. 27, 2019, posts said. ""You won't see that this year under Governor (Tony) Evers, despite the continued surplus.""
A graphic accompanying the text stamped the word ""CANCELED"" across a description of the sales tax holiday categories.

The Twitter version of the post was retweeted by several Republican legislators, including Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna.
So, did Evers really cancel the sales tax?
How the 2018 holiday happened
Let’s start with the history.
Gov. Scott Walker introduced a sales tax holiday in his budget for 2017, but GOP lawmakers voted to kill it.
In 2018, lawmakers went through various versions of a sales tax holiday early in the year. The Assembly approved a bill in February that would have created a $50 million sales tax holiday on all goods under $100.
But an amendment introduced in March by Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, limited the sales tax holiday to specific school-related categories. They included clothing and school supplies under $75 per item and computers under $750.
That version passed both houses and was signed into law by Walker. It reduced the expected consumer savings (and, therefore, lost state revenue) to about $14 million, according to an estimate from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.
It made Wisconsin one of 17 states with a sales tax holiday in 2018, according to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank.
But Republicans were explicitly clear that this was a one-time deal.
The statutory language included a note that ""This subsection does not apply in 2019 or in any year thereafter.""
And Walker’s veto message (which didn’t change the nature of the holiday) also noted the holiday ""will not recur in future years.""
Assessing the blame on Evers
This year, Republicans — who still control the state Legislature — never proposed a sales tax holiday, noted Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback.
""Republicans specifically prevented the 2018 back-to-school holiday from being offered in 2019 and any year thereafter,"" she said in an email. ""If Republicans wanted to extend the 2018 back-to-school sales tax holiday, they would have had to pass legislation this year to do so.""
RELATED: Republicans botch claim comparing tuition for immigrants, veterans
RELATED: GOP blames Evers’ budget for potential property tax hike
Adam King, director of social media for the Assembly Republican Caucus, pointed to an Evers quote as evidence supporting the post’s claim.
""Parents are going to be out there purchasing their kids' supplies whether they have an incentive or not,"" Evers said at a July 29, 2019, press conference. ""I just don’t think the incentive actually worked.""
Said King: ""By making this statement, the governor effectively shut the door on any possibility that a tax holiday could be implemented this year.""
But that timeline defies logic. If Republicans wanted a sales tax holiday, they would have introduced the measure months before that comment. Certainly before the Legislature passed the final version of the budget in late June.
As a quick aside, Evers’ comment does appear to misconstrue the intent of the sales tax holiday — Republicans intended it as tax relief in the wake of a General Fund surplus, and his comment treated it as an economic incentive.
A 2018 study from the Tax Foundation found sales tax holidays don’t promote economic growth, they just shift the timing of purchases. It called the holidays ""political gimmicks"" that ""distract policymakers and taxpayers from genuine, permanent tax relief.""
But that doesn’t play into the veracity of this claim.
Our ruling
Assembly Republicans said Evers ""canceled"" the 2019 sales tax holiday.
You can’t cancel something that was expressly created as a one-time occurrence.
Republicans could have introduced a new bill creating another sales tax holiday this year, but they didn’t. And Evers’ comments showing a lack of support for such a measure didn’t come until months after Republicans would have needed to broach the subject.
We rate this claim False."

There’s no evidence to support that Washington ever said or wrote this.

The statement was written in that ""Pamphlet #230"" under the byline Joe Spenner.
The quote appears to belong to the author — Spenner — not Washington. It shows up in the introduction of the pamphlet and does not have quotation marks encasing it. Below the introduction, the author instructs readers to ""read the attached comments about ‘The Role of Firearms,’ by President George Washington and help spread their wisdom."" 
What follows is a line across the screen and a series of quotations that appear to be attributed to Washington. But at least some of those quotations are also included on Mount Vernon’s spurious quotations page.  
Barry Popik, an etymologist and consulting editor for the Oxford English Dictionary, also researched the quote in 2014. Based on information from the Wayback Machine tool of the Internet Archive, he surmised that the quote was written around 2002.

10,"Says Dan Bishop ""took the only vote from either party — the only vote — against pharmacists being able to tell people about lower-cost drugs.""","on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2019",http://politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2019/sep/03/dan-mccready/nc-congressional-race-mccready-says-bishop-was-lon/,Half-True,Dan McCready,"In N.C. congressional race, McCready says Bishop was lone vote against pharmacy bill | PolitiFact North Carolin","All eyes are on North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, where candidates are trading accusations about health care in the final days before a Sept. 10 special election.
At a WBTV debate Aug. 28, Democrat Dan McCready accused Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop of voting against a bill that would allow pharmacists to inform people about cheaper alternative drugs.
""He took the only vote from either party — the only vote — against pharmacists being able to tell people about lower-cost drugs,"" McCready said.
It’s a claim McCready has repeated throughout the race on social media and in an attack ad.
He’s talking about The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, which banned gag orders discouraging pharmacists from offering customers cheaper alternative drugs. It passed 115-0 in the House and 45-1 in the Senate in 2017. 
And in fact, Bishop was the only member of the North Carolina General Assembly to vote against the bill before Gov. Roy Cooper signed it into law.
On the debate stage, Bishop said his opposition was ""for procedural reasons."" When he’s been confronted with the charge before, the state senator has said he didn’t have time to read the final version of the House bill before the vote and noted that he supported a similar Senate bill.
We asked both campaigns about Bishop’s position on the policy. While it’s true that Bishop cast the lone vote against The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, his votes and statements indicate he’s in favor of allowing pharmacists to tell people about cheaper alternative drugs as long as that doesn’t burden pharmacies — and, in turn, customers — with higher costs.
Bishop supports banning pharmacy gag orders
The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act was introduced in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly in March 2017.
Over the next several weeks, those identical bills made their way through various committees in the House and Senate that amended their language. In the Senate version, Bishop backed changes that his campaign says were designed to protect consumers from additional costs. 
On April 26, the bill that Bishop helped revise unanimously passed in the state Senate.
When a House version of the bill was added to the calendar on June 28, Bishop says he didn’t have time to read the bill to check that it included similar amendments.
""That was a big sticking point for him,"" said Jessica Proud, a spokesperson for Bishop’s campaign. ""He didn’t feel comfortable voting for legislation without ensuring that those changes had been made."" (If he had, he would have found the bill was indeed identical.)
Didn’t have time
How should elected officials vote when they haven’t done their homework?
Bishop says he votes no on any legislation he hasn’t fully read. In an email to the Charlotte television station WBTV, Bishop responded to McCready’s claim: ""This companion House version was added to the Senate calendar on June 28 at the last minute and, unlike Nancy Pelosi’s advice on Obamacare, I don’t vote for bills without an opportunity to read them.""
But McCready has questioned why Bishop didn’t have time to read a bill less than two pages long.
""State Senator Bishop refused to even read the bill that would let pharmacists tell people about lower-cost drugs even though it was shorter than ‘Green Eggs and Ham,’"" he said at the debate.
(We counted, and The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act comes in at about 200 words shorter than Dr. Seuss’s ""Green Eggs and Ham."")
When we asked the state senator’s campaign about his lack of preparation, Proud explained that the vote followed a debate on a workers’ compensation bill that Bishop authored. The General Assembly’s website shows that votes on The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act and Bishop’s workers’ compensation bill occurred less than an hour apart.
Our ruling
McCready said Bishop was the only member of the House or Senate to vote against a bill allowing pharmacists to tell people about lower-cost drugs. The roll call confirms that is correct. 
However, McCready ignores the fact that Bishop supported an identical version of the bill. That vote and his statements indicate he supports the policy.

10,"Florida’s red flag gun law has been used ""about five times a day.""","on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2019",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/sep/03/dave-aronberg/explaining-how-floridas-red-flag-gun-law-works/,True,Dave Aronberg,How Florida’s red flag gun law works | PolitiFact Florid,"Law enforcement officials are using Florida’s so-called ""red flag"" law to remove guns from people five times a day.
That’s what Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said on MSNBC when asked about the state’s implementation of the red flag law, enacted after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting.
""That law is being used by law enforcement to get a judge to take away guns from someone who is deemed a threat to himself or others,"" Aronberg, a Democrat, told ""Morning Joe"" host Mika Brzezinski on Aug. 26. ""It has been used about 2,500 times in the state of Florida in the past year and a half. That’s about five times a day.""
As recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton renew calls to pass red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger, we wanted to look closer at Aronberg’s claim and examine how the Florida law is changing how guns are treated day to day.
About 15 states have red flag or extreme risk laws. The laws allow police to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous, or to block the person from obtaining a firearm. After a set amount of time, the firearm is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. (In some states, family members can petition a court to remove the firearm, but in Florida relatives have to contact the police.)
We found Aronberg correctly cited state court data on the number of times a judge has issued a risk protection order.
Florida’s red flag law
Aronberg told us he got his number about the roughly 2,500 cases from an NPR story. (The Tampa Bay Times previously reported the same ballpark figure.) That works out to around five per day since the law took effect in March 2018.
Since then through July 2019, there were 2,396 risk protection orders issued by judges statewide. Counties with the highest number of orders were Polk (378), Pinellas (350), Broward (327), Volusia (173) and Miami-Dade (127).
We interviewed law enforcement officials in Broward and Pinellas counties about how they have implemented the law.
Broward’s chief judge Jack Tuter said that when a law enforcement agency determines a person poses a threat to himself or others, the agency requests a risk protection order. A judge holds a hearing within 24 hours with the police officers who swear to the allegations. If the judge enters the temporary risk protection order, the judge will order a search of the respondent's home to secure any firearms or ammunition. 
Within a couple of weeks, a judge holds a final hearing at which point a person can oppose the order. This is a civil process, so the respondent is allowed to hire a lawyer but there is no right to a court-appointed lawyer.
Tuter estimated that in 90% of the cases, the orders are agreed to by the respondent. The order can last for up to a year and then law enforcement can seek to renew it. The person’s name is also entered into the national database to prevent federal dealers from selling the person a firearm. 
Risk protection orders require judges to take a different outlook than they would for a typical criminal case in which a judge is evaluating past behavior. Judges are asked to predict a person’s future behavior ⁠— ""whether the person is going to carry out the threat,"" Tuter said. 
Statewide data show that the vast majority of petitions lead to judges granting the orders. PolitiFact found no public record that showed the total number of guns surrendered, but Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in his county people surrendered about 700 firearms and over 135,000 rounds of ammunition.
Gualtieri said that one man who was fired from his restaurant job for making inappropriate advances to female employees sent text messages indicating he planned to shoot the women and himself. He was arrested, and then law enforcement sought a risk protection order and found he had an AR-15 and 471 rounds of ammunition.
Kristi MacKenzie, an attorney for the Broward Sheriff’s Office, estimated that around 25% of the risk protection order cases have a parallel criminal case. In other situations, the person has committed no crime, but has prompted concerns that the person poses a danger. 
In a case handled by Lighthouse Point police, a man acted strangely and turned off electrical breakers in his condo building ""to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him,"" according to court records. The man told police he was being targeted by a neighbor who looked like Osama bin Laden. He voluntarily surrendered his firearms.
There have been some misconceptions that the law provides no due process or that police are simply seizing guns, but that’s not the case.
When a Broward sheriff deputy flags a case, it must first be approved by higher-ups in the sheriff’s office and then reviewed by at least two attorneys before it goes to a judge.
""There are a lot of layers of protection there,"" MacKenzie said.
Our ruling
Aronberg said Florida’s red flag gun law has been used ""about five times a day"" since it was enacted about a year and a half ago.
His math is correct. Between March 2018 and July 2019, there were about 2,400 risk protection orders issued statewide. That means people were prevented from having a gun temporarily, but we don’t know in total how many guns were surrendered.
We rate this statement True."

That’s what one viral Facebook post is claiming. The post, which has gotten over 200 comments and reached nearly 10,000 shares since Aug. 16, says that the United States gives Israel ""$3 billion annually"" and gives Detroit ""zero.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This is a mixed claim. Israel does receive billions from the U.S. in federal aid each year, but Detroit also receives federal funds annually. 
Israel does, indeed, receive $3 billion from the U.S. annually, and has over the last decade, making it the ""largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II,"" according to an August 2019 report by the Congressional Research Service. 
That amount is going to go up, too. Signed in 2016, a new 10-year agreement between the two countries increased the annual aid to $3.8 billion, which will run from fiscal years 2019 to 2028, the CRS report says. Most of the money – $3.3 billion – will go to military financing.
But the part of the claim that says Detroit receives zero federal funds is plain wrong. 
When Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013, the largest city to do so in the country, the federal government pledged about $300 million in assistance, although that was only a fraction of the billions the city owed. 
The amount of federal funds Detroit has gotten has fluctuated over the years and includes assistance through federal grants and programs.
According to the city’s yearly Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), it received $109.5 million in 2015, $93.1 million in 2016, and $97.6 million in 2017 in federal funds. In 2018, the most recently available report, the city received the lowest amount in recent years at $73.2 million.
That doesn’t include other money spent by the federal government in Detroit on projects that help the community – like highways, airports and public transportation. Nor does it include any assistance provided by the federal government to residents and businesses of Detroit. 
Our ruling
A social media post says that while Israel receives $3 billion from the U.S. in aid annually, Detroit gets ""zero.""
It is true that Israel receives billions from the U.S. in foreign aid each year, making it the largest recipient of foreign assistance over the last several decades. 
But it is not true that Detroit gets zero dollars from the federal government. The city receives much less than Israel directly, but it routinely collects tens of millions in revenue from federal funds.

10,"""Most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a 'worst case scenario' including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines.""","on Sunday, September 1st, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/sep/01/sean-casten/does-science-say-time-running-out-stop-climate-dis/,Mostly True,Sean Casten,Does science say time is running out to stop climate disaster? | PolitiFact Illinois,"In a recent campaign email, U.S. Rep. Sean Casten repeated a talking point often used by Democrats about how little time remains to turn the tide on climate change.
""Most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a 'worst case scenario' including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines,"" read the email, which was attributed to Casten.
Casten, a former clean-energy entrepreneur who flipped Illinois’ west suburban 6th Congressional District for the Democrats in 2018, isn’t the first politician to contend the planet faces a hard deadline on climate change. Prominent Democrats, including presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, made similar claims earlier this year that were contradicted by scientists in fact-checks by The Associated Press and CNN.
Casten’s claim and others like it trace back to a 2018 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
That report said nations must take ""unprecedented"" actions to reduce emissions, which will need to be on a significantly different trajectory by 2030 in order to avoid more severe impacts from increased warming. However, it did not identify the hard deadline Casten and others have suggested. In part, that’s because serious effects from climate change have already begun.
What the experts say
The panel predicted that if warming continues at its current rate global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. If temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, the report cautioned, the planet will face greater disruptions, some of which ""may be long-lasting or irreversible."" To keep temperatures from rising above that temperature, the report stated with high confidence that carbon dioxide emissions would need to start dropping ""well before 2030"" and be on a path to fall by nearly half by 2030.
Following the report’s release last October, a popular narrative began to emerge that there were only 12 years left to act in order to avoid the most extreme consequences of climate change. But experts say that conclusion overstates the report’s findings, which drew on the work of hundreds of scientists.
James Skea, co-chairman of the IPCC report and a sustainable energy professor at Imperial College London, told The Associated Press in March that the panel ""did not say we have 12 years left to save the world.""
We followed up with Skea, who confirmed the panel has not published any work since then that supports the hard deadline Casten suggested.
In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Casten’s campaign sent us several sources, two of which focused on the IPCC report. One of them, a recent article from InsideClimate News, explained the timeline for reducing emissions laid out by the IPCC does not mean 2030 is the threshold for climate disaster.
Framing it as a hard deadline is ""more of a messaging tool than a physical science reality,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Center for Climate and Weather Extremes, who was quoted in the piece.
""The next decade is indeed a critical window in which to achieve enough technological, economic and policy momentum toward a carbon-neutral world while minimizing societal disruption,"" he told us. ""But on the other hand there's no geophysical cliff at the end of the decade that makes all our efforts moot if we don't make it all the way.""
Duke University climate researcher Drew Shindell, a lead author of the IPCC report’s chapter on mitigation, told us the panel indeed found that ""if we are not on a greatly different path by 2030 than our current trajectory we cannot keep within the 1.5 [degree Celsius] warming target.""
""But we won't necessarily face a 'worst-case scenario' if we don't act in less than a decade as acting during the 2030’s is still better than waiting until say the 2040’s, so there's always an even worse case,"" he said.
Shindell and others also pointed out that serious effects of global warming, including rising sea levels and worsening droughts, are challenges we already face today and will continue to grow regardless.
Our ruling
Casten said that ""most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a ‘worst case scenario’ including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines.""
A 2018 UN climate report determined a significant decrease in carbon emissions by 2030 is necessary in order to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in years to come, and to mitigate even more severe effects of a warming planet.
Experts told us action taken to decrease emissions in the next decade will be critical. However, they said it’s an oversimplification to suggest we face a hard deadline of a decade to address climate change before crossing a threshold into climate disaster.
We rate Casten’s claim Mostly True.

10,"Says Dan McCready ""believes in open borders and sanctuary cities.""","on Friday, August 30th, 2019",http://politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2019/aug/30/donald-trump/trump-misleads-nc-about-dan-mccreadys-immigration-/,Mostly False,Donald Trump,Trump misleads NC about Dan McCready's immigration stances | PolitiFact North Carolin,"A North Carolina Congressional race may provide some fresh clues about how Americans are feeling about President Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Trump plans to hold a rally in Fayetteville on Sept. 9, the day before the special election for District 9, a race that pits Republican N.C. Sen. Dan Bishop against Democrat Dan McCready.
But voters don’t have to wait for Trump to take the stage to hear his thoughts on McCready. Trump recently took to Twitter to weigh-in.
""Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks, in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities, and won’t protect your Second Amendment!"" Trump tweeted on Aug. 27.
Is it fair for Trump to say McCready has supported ""open borders and sanctuary cities?""
PolitiFact could find no evidence of McCready using those specific words, so we reached out to the Trump campaign. Samantha Cotten, a regional communications director for the campaign, sent a document that listed McCready’s comments about immigration.
Cotten points to three instances that she said back up Trump’s claim: McCready supports the DREAM Act; he has been ""evasive"" when asked how he’d handle undocumented immigrants in the U.S.; and he opposes a state bill that would require sheriffs to comply with federal immigration authorities.
While McCready opposed a bill that would crack down on sanctuary policies, that doesn’t mean he supports sanctuary cities. And Trump’s claim about open borders is unfounded.
We’ll explain.

OPEN BORDERS
The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, better known as the DREAM Act, was first introduced in 2001 and never passed. It aimed to help immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.
A similar bill introduced in by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., in 2017 would have granted a path to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants who met specific criteria, such as reaching certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment.
That bill mostly applies to children who were brought to the United States and are already here, so it’s not accurate to characterize it as an ""open borders"" policy.
Now to McCready’s alleged ""evasiveness."" Cotten provided a link to a Charlotte Observer editorial board column from October 2018 to support her claim. The Observer wrote that McCready ""dodged direct questions"" about how he would handle immigrants who are currently in the U.S. illegally.
But in that column, McCready was quoted saying that immigration reform ""starts with securing the border."" In fact, he has repeatedly said he wants to secure the border. His comments to WFAE and in a recent WBTV debate echo the position outlined on his website.
When asked in the debate how he’d handle migrant families at the border, McCready said: ""We absolutely need a secure border. If some Democrats are saying we don’t need a secure border, that’s crazy. Now, I don’t think we need 3,000 miles of wall to do it. I think we can use the type of surveillance technology I used over in Iraq,"" he said, referring to his experience as a Marine.
McCready’s plans for undocumented immigrants living in America might be vague. But that doesn’t mean he favors open borders.
SANCTUARY CITIES
Here, Trump has a little more of a case.
There’s no single definition of what constitutes a ""sanctuary city,"" but the term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. California state law, for instance, prohibits law enforcement agencies from using local funds or personnel to investigate or arrest individuals for immigration purposes.
In North Carolina, municipalities can’t block their law enforcement agencies from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE.
A recent bill, HB 370, would have changed that by requiring North Carolina sheriffs to honor ICE detainers, but Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the bill. If it had become law, sheriffs would have to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE. As PolitiFact NC has previously reported, ICE detainers aren’t valid warrants.
In an Aug. 23 interview with WBT-FM, McCready said he thought Cooper’s veto ""was the right call."" But that doesn’t mean McCready supports sanctuary cities, said his spokesman Matt Fried.
""No, Dan doesn’t support a ‘sanctuary city.’ Violent criminals belong in jail in every city,"" Fried told PolitiFact in an email.
An analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies isn’t convinced by McCready’s explanation. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for CIS, which favors low immigration, says she believes Trump’s tweet is fair.
""The only reason to oppose the bill is to facilitate sanctuary policies,"" Vaughan said, adding, ""If someone says that they want sheriffs to have the option to obstruct ICE, that is a statement that is explicitly in favor of sanctuary policies.""
OTHER REACTION TO TRUMP TWEET
Other experts believe Trump’s accusations come up short.
One of them is Peter H. Schuck, an emeritus professor of law at Yale University and scholar-in-residence at New York University. In an op-ed for The Los Angeles Times July 2, he cautioned Democrats against embracing open borders.
McCready’s position ""does not imply that he favors ‘open borders,’ though he would be open to a charge that his favored policies would ‘not do enough’ to secure the borders,"" Schuck told PolitiFact in an email.
""As for sanctuary cities, not cooperating with ICE detainers is certainly what ‘sanctuary cities’ do but whether that’s enough to qualify as creating sanctuary city depends on how one defines the term,"" he said.
We asked Larry Sabato, founder and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, whether he thinks Trump’s tweet is fair.
""Democrats will say it isn’t and Republicans will say it is. That’s where we are in the post-factual era,"" Sabato said in a phone interview. ""Personally, I think it’s a stretch by the White House. But it’s not completely fabricated which, given Trump’s tweets, is an accomplishment.""
Indeed, the terms — ""open borders"" and ""sanctuary city"" — are ""both so amorphous they can mean whatever someone wants it to mean,"" said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst for the Migration Policy Institute.
But she doesn’t think McCready supports open borders, a term that implies no consequences for people who enter the country illegally.
""When someone is saying they’re interested in border security and pointing to technology he used in Iraq, that’s clearly not someone who believes there should be no consequences,"" Bolter said in a phone interview.
And she doesn’t think supporting HB 370 — the vetoed North Carolina law on ICE detainers — is the same as endorsing sanctuary cities.
""Not having a policy of honoring detainers isn’t the same as telling sheriffs they can’t honor detainers,"" Bolter said. ""Sheriffs still have the ability to honor detainers, whereas in some other cities or states the policies say they can’t.""
OUR RULING
Trump tweeted that McCready ""believes in open borders and sanctuary cities."" There’s no evidence that McCready supports open borders. And, while McCready opposes a bill requiring sheriffs to comply with ICE, he hasn’t said he believes sheriffs should be prohibited from working with ICE.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

10,"Says President Donald Trump has been ""taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers.""","on Friday, August 30th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/30/pete-buttigieg/fact-checking-whether-fema-funds-were-shifted-inde/,Half-True,Pete Buttigieg,-checking whether FEMA funds were shifted to indefinite detention at the border,"As Hurricane Dorian bore down on Florida, Democrats accused President Donald Trump of taking money intended for natural disasters and using it instead for his priorities on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Several Democratic presidential candidates tweeted criticism of the administration’s move. One — South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — tweeted on Aug. 28, ""Taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers is unconscionable. It is unworthy of the presidency and unworthy of the United States.""
Taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers is unconscionable. It is unworthy of the presidency and unworthy of the United States. https://t.co/vHJYduZmMj— Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 28, 2019 
On the matter of removing money from disaster relief, Buttigieg’s description of what happened is correct. But he’s off-base in what he says about the money being used to ""indefinitely"" detain asylum seekers.
Where is the money coming from?
Facing an influx of asylum-seeking migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including many families from Central America, Trump has pursued a variety of measures designed to limit the migrants’ ability to make it into the United States and to remain in the country as they await their judicial hearings.
On July 26, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it was ""reprogramming"" some of the funds that Congress had allocated to the department.
All told, the department said it would transfer a total of $271 million toward immigration efforts.
About $112 million of this sum isn’t directly relevant for analyzing Buttigieg’s tweet, because it would be taken from the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, DHS management accounts, and several other offices within DHS.
But the remaining $158.4 million would, as Buttigieg said, come from FEMA, the agency that handles disaster prevention and recovery. 
Most of the FEMA money being reprogrammed to the border — $155 million — would come from the disaster relief fund base budget, which is spent on recovering from natural disasters. The remaining $3.4 million would be transferred from disaster mitigation, which includes grant funds that allow local jurisdictions susceptible to natural disasters to undertake infrastructure projects that limit future disaster risks.
It’s worth noting that the funding shift won’t decimate FEMA’s available funding for disaster-hit areas; the federal government has a process in place to provide disaster relief. But it could have some effect, depending on the severity of the storm season.

Where is the money going?
DHS has earmarked the $271 million being sent to the border for two specific purposes.
One pot of money, worth $116 million (but only $3.4 million taken from FEMA accounts), would be used to pay for beds for adults who were detained and for transporting them to and from immigration hearings.
""These additional beds are required in order to manage the crisis at the Southwest border and expediently transfer aliens from overcrowded Border Patrol stations,"" DHS wrote. The remainder of this money would be spent on transportation — ""the safe and secure transfer of migrants from the Border Patrol to ICE detention facilities"" as well as transporting migrants to hearings with immigration judges.
The second pot of money the department would transfer came to $155 million. This would fund the construction of hearing facilities under the Migrant Protection Protocol, or MPP. 
Under the Migrant Protection Protocols, ""certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico – illegally or without proper documentation – may be returned to Mexico and wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings, where Mexico will provide them with all appropriate humanitarian protections for the duration of their stay.""
This additional workload demanded new courtroom infrastructure, DHS said. ""Current courts have infrastructure capacity and security limitations that are being exceeded by the addition of MPP cases to the existing non-detained docket,"" the department wrote.
Criticism of the shift
These funding shifts drew criticism.
Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, said she ""strongly"" disagreed with the department’s action. ""DHS has ignored the negotiated agreement with Congress by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations,"" she wrote.
And Steve Ellis, executive vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the shift amounted to ""robbing Peter to pay Paul."" He added that ""much of the major disaster funding is already targeted to previous disasters, such as Maria which savaged Puerto Rico in 2017.""
The Trump campaign countered that Obama did something similar during a previous border crisis in 2014 and that Democrats have known about this decision for a month and only decided to complain with a hurricane approaching ""to score political points."" (Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator under Obama, told NPR that the part about Obama using a similar maneuver was accurate.)
Overall, though, Buttigieg is correct to say that Trump has taken ""money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster"" for other purposes.
Evaluating Buttigieg’s description
However, Buttigieg conflates the situation with the second part of his assertion – that the money taken from FEMA will be used ""to indefinitely detain asylum seekers.""
Buttigieg’s notion isn’t conjured from whole cloth. The Trump administration has pursued a policy of directing immigration judges not to allow migrants to be released on bail after they have established ""a credible fear of persecution or torture"" in the home country. The Trump administration decision overturned a policy that had been in place since 2005, and given backlogs, it could lead to months or years of detention until their cases are heard.
However, the Trump administration policy change was blocked by a federal judge in Seattle. The legal battle is continuing. 
It’s also worth noting that, given how DHS divvied up the transferred money, just a small fraction of the money taken from FEMA — about 2 percent — would go toward detainee housing and transportation that could be considered the ""indefinite detention"" Buttigieg cited. 
The other 98 percent of the money taken from FEMA would go toward building hearing facilities for individuals who are to be kept in Mexico while awaiting their proceedings. It’s a stretch to call that money spent on indefinitely detaining migrants. In theory, faster hearings would end indefinite detention, not encourage it.
""It is not exactly right to say that the money was reprogrammed for ‘indefinite’ detention,"" said Denise L. Gilman, director of the immigration clinic and a clinical professor at the University of Texas-Austin Law School. A more accurate statement would be that ""the $3.4 million is being reprogrammed to fund ‘expanded and prolonged’ detention of asylum seekers.""
The Buttigieg campaign said it stood by the candidate’s tweet, citing the administration’s opposition to the judge’s ruling and its assertion that that the money is needed to fix shortages caused by its own policies.
Our ruling
Buttigieg said Trump has been ""taking money Congress authorized to protect people facing disaster in order to indefinitely detain asylum seekers.""
Buttigieg was correct about the money shift, which involves more than $158 million being taken from FEMA accounts. But he exaggerated somewhat when he said the funds taken from FEMA would be used ""to indefinitely detain asylum seekers."" That policy has been blocked by a federal judge, and all but a small fraction of the money taken from FEMA would be used for building new facilities for immigration hearings, not for indefinite detention.

10,"The push by Assembly Democrats seeking Americans with Disabilities Act accommodations for a lawmaker were timed to make Vos look bad as he became president ""of the nation’s largest bipartisan organization called the National Conference of State Legislatures.""","on Friday, August 30th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/aug/30/robin-vos/vos-misses-mark-claim-over-timing-disability-accom/,False,Robin Vos,Vos misses mark with claim over timing of disability accommodation dispute | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, believes there was an agenda behind the push by Democrats for accommodations for a new lawmaker under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
The agenda, as Vos described it: To embarrass Vos as he stepped into a national-level post.
Here is the background: 
State Rep. Jimmy Anderson, elected in 2018, was paralyzed from the chest down in 2010 after a drunken driver collided with the vehicle he was traveling in, killing his family and permanently injuring him. The Democrat from Fitchburg uses a wheelchair to get around. 
On Aug. 14, 2019, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel posted a story that said all 36 Democratic members of the Assembly asked Vos and Republican leaders to allow Anderson to call in to meetings he can’t attend in person, and make other adjustments to Assembly rules.
The accommodations, they said, fell under federal ADA requirements. The letter was dated Aug. 8, 2019. No Republicans signed it.
Additionally, Anderson and other Democrats have asked Vos to refrain from calling overnight floor sessions that aren’t an emergency and that an ADA coordinator be assigned to determine which accommodation requests should be granted. 
The day after the story appeared, Vos told conservative radio host Jay Weber on 1130 WISN the timing of the request was fishy, since it aligned with his new position as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
""The fact that they launched this during the same week I got to become the president of the nation’s largest bipartisan organization called the National Conference of State Legislatures, first person from Wisconsin, does not seem like an accident to me,"" Vos told Weber on Aug. 15, 2019. ""Everything they do is political and based on trying to make the other side look bad.""
Vos told Weber he felt that lawmakers phoning in to meetings was disrespectful, because they are paid to be present. Additionally, Vos said, you wouldn’t be able to be sure they were really paying attention if they phoned in.
Vos has said Anderson could listen to recordings of hearings and meetings he may miss, but that he would not be able to phone into them so he could participate and vote.
So, Vos has claimed the accommodations request from Anderson and the Democrats was timed to embarrass him.
We decided to take a closer look at the timeline of what happened.
The timeline
Anderson’s office provided a Jan. 23, 2019, email that Anderson sent to the chief of staff for Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, as the starting point. 
That email, sent by Anderson at 12:55 p.m., asked that any meeting of the Assembly have 24-hour notice; that none extend beyond 24 hours; that all be held within reasonable hours; and that individuals with disabilities be allowed to attend by phone or teleconference.
Here is a summary of what happened next:
Feb. 7, 2019: Through a formal negotiation, or Memorandum of Understanding over rules for the session, Democrats bring the requests to Republican state leaders in further detail.
April 16, 2019: GOP leaders reject Anderson’s request to call into sessions and meetings and that the Assembly recess no later than 10 p.m., reconvening the following day if debate went longer. Republicans say they would try to limit meetings to 12 hours and said if they were expected to go longer, would provide appropriate notice to members. This is based on a document outlining the negotiations provided by Anderson’s office.
May 15, 2019: Democrats say the 12-hour parameters, and not allowing Anderson to call into meetings, do not address accessibility concerns.
May 31, 2019: Anderson contacts reporter Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 
May 31, 2019: Marley asks Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer what Vos thinks of lawmakers being able to call into meetings, if he would introduce a policy that allows it and, if not, why not.
June 4, 2019: Beyer responds to Marley saying Assembly rules don’t allow members to phone into committees and Vos does not support changing the rule.
July 29, 2019: The Journal Sentinel publishes a story that describes the dispute after Vos tells the newspaper he thinks it is ""disrespectful for someone to be asking questions over a microphone or a speakerphone.""
Aug. 8, 2019: The Democrats send their letter to Republican leadership. 
That same day, Vos becomes president of NCSL.
The story about the Aug. 8 letter -- and a suggestion by Anderson that he may file a lawsuit -- was published a week later. That story is what prompted Vos’ claim on the Jay Weber show that it was -- in essence -- a move timed to embarrass him.
But the timeline shows that Anderson’s efforts began almost immediately after he took office in January 2019 -- nearly seven months before Vos took the post in question.
Vos’ office did not respond to requests from PolitiFact.
Our ruling
Vos claimed the accommodation request for Anderson was timed to embarrass him as he took over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
But records show the effort began months and months earlier.
We rate Vos’ claim False."
10,"""Some 200,000 people are in jail for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford bail.""","on Thursday, August 29th, 2019",http://politifact.com/california/statements/2019/aug/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-half-true-claim-number-people-jail-/,Half-True,Bernie Sanders,Bernie Sanders’ Half True claim on number of people in jail who can’t afford bail | PolitiFact Californ,"Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders recently claimed ""some 200,000 people are in jail for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford bail.""
He made that claim during a campaign speech in Sacramento last week, just blocks from the California State Capitol, where former Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law last year to abolish cash bail and adopt a risk-assessment system.
Sanders introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate in 2018 to end cash bail nationwide. It’s part of his criminal justice reform platform. But the issue remains unsettled, including in California. 
In January, the bail industry qualified a referendum for the state’s November 2020 ballot, giving voters a say on whether to eliminate cash bail. 
Given the focus on this topic, we wanted to know whether Sanders’ figure of ""some 200,000"" is accurate. 
Our research 
In the past, PolitiFact has reported there is no official national tracking of this number, though researchers have used data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics to extrapolate how many people might be in jail because they can’t afford bail. 
They point to the bureau’s 2018 report which uses 2016 data. It says there were 458,600 ""unconvicted"" people held in jails across the country. Some, however, were held without bail and others were awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility. 
For those reasons, PolitiFact rated Half True a related claim by California Rep. Ted Lieu last year. It found the Deomocratic congressman overestimated the total when he said: ""Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys.""
Sanders’ campaign said his 200,000 figure is ""a safe estimate"" based on a December 2018 report by the Hamilton Project, an arm of the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan research group. But that report puts the figure far higher. 
""There are more than 400,000 people in jail whom a judge would have allowed to be released had they been able to post bail,"" it says. 
Ryan Nunn, one of the report’s authors, told us the 400,000 number ""is definitely a ballpark estimate."" He said his report relied on 2009 data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
Shima Baradaran Baughman is a law professor at the University of Utah, where she’s written extensively about cash bail. 
""It seems like a low estimate,"" she said of Sanders’ figure. 
Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida who has also studied the topic, emphasized that all the figures are estimates. 
""I am not aware of any national database that tracks the number of people who are in jail because they cannot pay bail,"" Hutchinson said in an email. ""Most of the recent studies on this issue continue to rely on projections that compare the average income and available assets of individuals detained in jails and an estimate of the average bail amount."" 
""It is entirely possible that the number of detainees who cannot afford bail exceeds the figure Sanders stated,"" he added. 
Sanders was quoted last year in an article by The Guardian placing the number at ""400,000 people,"" which matches estimates in recent studies. 
Our ruling 
Sen. Bernie Sanders recently claimed ""some 200,000 people are in jail for the crime of being poor and not being able to afford bail.""
Experts say there is no national database that tracks this figure, only estimates. The report Sanders cited placed the figure closer to 400,000.
Still, experts told us Sanders’ overall point is right: Many Americans languish in jail for the sole reason they can’t afford bail. 
In the end, we found his claim was partially accurate but underestimates the total. 
We rate it Half True. 

HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

She's close,"To Elizabeth Warren’s list of plans, add improving rural broadband. In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Warren wrote that over 21 million Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. She blamed the major internet service providers, such as Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Charter, for profiting at the expense of rural communities and others.
""We lag behind many other developed nations in connectivity and speed, while also paying more for that service,"" Warren continued.
We decided to see where the United States stands compared with its peers.
Trying to measure this is challenging but Warren’s comments are broad enough that experts say it’s generally accurate. The United States does lag behind other nations by some measures, but rarely is it among the worst performers and it has also gained ground in recent years when it comes to its high speed offerings.
The FCC rankings
Warren cited the latest numbers from the Federal Communications Commission. The agency looks at speed, price and the reach of broadband in 26 countries, plus the United States.
The list includes Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Some things to note when making international comparisons: The United States is less densely populated than Europe, which raises costs here. Fixed broadband and mobile broadband are measured separately, and rankings can vary. The 21 million figure Warren cites in her claim refers to those without a fixed, on-the-ground connection.
Michael J. Santorelli, director of the Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute at New York Law School, urged caution when comparing nations on this topic. 
""Each country’s broadband market is highly unique, having been shaped by factors like regulatory regime, population density, income, and consumer demand, among many others.""
With that in mind, here’s some of what the FCC found based on 2016 numbers.
Speed
For fixed broadband, the United States ranked 10th on download speed. The tiny country of Luxembourg was way out in the lead with a median download speed of 358 Mbps (megabits per second). After Luxembourg, the speed drops fast. No. 2 Iceland posted a speed of 96 Mbps. The United States was in a tight cluster in the 55 Mbps range, with Spain and Denmark a little faster, and Norway and Portugal a little slower. 
Rankings are always a little dicey, because sometimes, tiny differences in speed put one country above another.
University of Pennsylvania law professor Christopher Yoo, who specializes in communications and information technology matters, noted that the United States has gained ground over the years. In 2012, the United States ranked 25th for fixed broadband.
""We seem to be in the top half and getting better,"" Yoo said.
On a similar measure for mobile broadband, the United States ranked 24th. With a speed of about 41 Mbps, the Netherlands was the winner. The United States clocked in about 19 Mbps, below Portugal, Italy and Czech Republic.
Price
The FCC has three ways to come up with prices to compare across all the countries. It uses average prices, and two other approaches that factor in the value of the service as well as variables like population size and density.
The results from the different methods vary widely: When it comes to average price, the United States ranks 18th. But when measured using the FCC’s more nuanced methods, it ranks 7th for fixed connection and 10th for mobile.  
Penn State telecommunications professor Rob Frieden generally agrees with Warren’s summary, but he says the big picture can mask that some American customers do better than their foreign counterparts.
""For so-called bandwidth hogs who stream lots and lots of video, the U.S. offers some of the lowest cost per megabit transmission speed and megabyte data delivered,"" Frieden said.
A British firm called, appropriately, Cable, also collects broadband price information worldwide. In its 2018 survey, based on average monthly cost, the United States ranked 23rd among a list of countries that is similar, but not identical, to the FCC’s list.
Connectivity
This is the area where the FCC report delivers more mixed signals.
The United States ranks 10th overall for the percentage of the population reached by its fixed broadband networks. For rural areas, the country ranks 9th.
But the FCC has no breakdown by country for mobile broadband.
Instead, the study compares the United States to a group of 21 European nations. In that light, the United States does better overall, but especially in rural areas: 98% of rural U.S. households have high-speed service. For the 21 EU nations, the fraction slips to 83%. But, using this FCC snapshot as a guide, we don’t have a clear picture of how the United States’ population using mobile broadband stacks up against countries that are not mentioned in this section of the report. 
Our ruling
Warren said that the United States lags ""behind many other developed nations in connectivity and speed, while also paying more for that service."" 
Her words are sufficiently broad to fit the government report she cited, but the numbers show the United States generally in the middle of the pack for speed, price and reach. 
While the top performing nations might stand out, in many cases, small differences in values determine their placement in the rankings.
Warren’s statement is generally accurate, but it needs context.
We rate this claim Mostly True."
11,"""1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving.""","on Wednesday, August 28th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/aug/28/tony-evers/evers-wrong-texting-and-driving-stat/,False,Tony Evers,Evers wrong on texting and driving stat | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Pushing safe driving on Twitter, Gov. Tony Evers urged state residents to buckle up, ditch distractions, drive sober and obey traffic laws.
Those phrases appeared in a graphic that accompanied Evers’ Aug. 20, 2019, tweet saying ""safe driving is everyone’s job.""
The graphic, created by Evers’ office, used a series of statistics in an attempt to drive home the point. It noted, for example, that seat belt use reduces injuries and that the blood-alcohol limit in Wisconsin is 0.08.
But this distractions stat stood out:
""1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving.""
Amid all the potential causes for a crash — weather, impaired driving, other technology-related distractions — does texting really account for a full 25%?
Let’s see if Evers’ took a wrong turn.

Experts say crash data is incomplete
The National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress, says distracted driving of any kind is difficult to track since local authorities don’t consistently record crash data.
The council used to track texting and driving, but stopped doing so in 2015 with the proliferation of in-vehicle technology (such as entertainment systems, navigation and phone-linked operating systems).
""The nature of distracted driving has changed with the explosion of built-in dashboard systems,"" said Ken Kolosh, the safety council’s manager of statistics.
The council has long used crash stats from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which compiles crash reports from local police agencies around the country. But those reports have not kept up with changes in technology.
A safety council report identified Wisconsin as one of a handful of states that require police to enter detailed information in each crash report showing how technology was involved. But that’s the exception rather than the rule.
Twenty-six states don’t even have a report field to identify texting as a cause of a crash. Only three states have crash report fields addressing built-in technology in vehicles.
A 2013 safety council study of fatal crash reports found that even when drivers admitted phone use to police, the officer listed cellphone use as a cause only half the time. 
""There are no reliable estimates of the number of crashes caused by distracted drivers,"" the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports on its website. ""Statistics based on police-reported crash data almost certainly underestimate the role of distraction in fatal crashes.""
The stats we do have
The insurance group said there is a clear connection between cellphone use and crash risk, based on several studies conducted over the last decade using in-vehicle cameras and sensors to monitor a sample of drivers.
Drivers manipulating a cellphone were two to six times more likely to crash compared to when they weren’t distracted.
But none of the available data shows a crash rate like the one Evers cited.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — while noting data concerns about inconsistent reporting between police agencies — reported in April 2019 that distracted driving accounted for 9% of fatal crashes in the U.S. in 2017.
Their analysis of crash report data showed 1.2% of fatal crashes were related to cellphone use as a distraction (401 out of 34,247).
The last statistics the safety council compiled on texting also fall well short of Evers’ claim.
A 2015 safety council analysis, based on 2013 data, found cellphones were a factor in 26% of all crashes, the same as the prior year.
But texting accounted for only 6% of crashes. The other 20% were classified as ""talking.""
More recent data focuses on driver behaviors rather than connecting them directly to crash frequency.
The traffic safety administration reports the number of drivers visibly manipulating a cellphone — based on an observational survey  — has risen slightly since then. But overall observed use of a handheld cellphone (not counting hands-free devices) has dropped from 4.6% in 2013 to 2.9% in 2017.
A 2016 safety council survey found 32% of drivers were willing to occasionally review or send text messages, and 20% to 25% said they were willing to review or send email, check social media or surf the Internet.
An Evers spokeswoman did not provide any evidence to support the texting and driving claim.
Our ruling
Evers said in a tweet that texting and driving accounts for 1 in 4 crashes nationwide.
The general point is right that distracted driving is a significant and deadly problem. And cellphone use is a core piece of that.
But the statistic he used to make that point is wrong.
Experts say we don’t have enough data to show how many crashes are currently related to texting. And the latest attempt to do that using 2013 data found only 6% of crashes were directly tied to texting — far short of what Evers’ claimed.
We rate this claim False."
11,"Crimea ""was sort of taken away from President Obama. … And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.""","on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-russia-crimea-obama/,Mostly False,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump misleads on Russia, Crimea, Obama and the G-8","President Donald Trump entered the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, urging his fellow members to re-admit Russia to the group, from which it had been expelled in 2014. Other G-7 members gave the idea a cool reception. 
During a post-summit question-and-answer session with journalists, Trump was asked about it.
Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked Trump, ""Why do you think it’s appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that they’ve meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because it’s only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election?
Trump said it was better to have Russia inside the room than outside, but he then turned his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. ""A lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama,"" Trump said. 
Trump cited Crimea, a peninsula located on the Black Sea. Following the ousting of Ukraine’s pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it into Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea had previously been part of Russia.).
""It was sort of taken away from President Obama,"" Trump said. ""Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the ‘G-8.’ And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama.""
Experts contacted by PolitiFact said Trump’s statement is filled with misleading assertions.
For starters, Russia did invade and, eventually, annex Crimea during Obama’s presidency -- in February and March 2014. But Russia didn’t take Crimea away from either Obama or the United States – it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it which it was an internationally recognized part.
Trump’s statement is ""a very odd way of thinking about Crimea and the United States’ role in Ukraine,"" said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. ""It is highly misleading and factually incorrect. The U.S. exercised a certain influence among certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians – how much and whom is disputed – but the U.S. never ‘had’ Crimea.""
In addition, Trump’s phrasing – ""sort of taken away"" – soft-pedals Russia’s coercive actions in seizing Crimea, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""This is not what you call a military occupation,"" Åslund said.
It’s also worth noting that, despite Trump’s focus on his predecessor, Obama wasn’t alone in opposing Russia’s annexation. Virtually the entire global community refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War.
""Europe, the United Nations and other U.S. allies opposed the invasion and annexation,"" said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. ""It wasn’t just Obama who opposed it.""
Trump’s statement is problematic for other reasons.
While the Obama administration did support Russia’s expulsion from the G-8 over the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not have acted unilaterally.
""The G-7 was united behind the decision to kick out Russia from G-8, so it was a common consensus decision,"" Åslund said.
In a communique dated March 24, 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Council and the European Commission jointly wrote that they ""strongly condemn"" Russia’s actions in Crimea.
The signatories agreed that they would not participate in a scheduled G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, and that they would ""suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.""
To date, the G-8 has not invited Russia back into the fold.
All in all, Trump ""seems to find it hard to believe that there could be any reason other than embarrassment to oppose aggression and territorial dismemberment of a major European state,"" said Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Our ruling
Trump said that Crimea ""was sort of taken away from President Obama. … And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.""
Obama did oppose Russia’s annexation of Crimea and back its expulsion from the G-8, but Trump’s view leaves out much of the story.
Trump’s remark ignores both widespread opposition to Russian’s actions within Europe and among U.S. allies, as well as the strongly worded decision by the remaining G-7 nations to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores that Crimea was ""taken away"" from Ukraine, not Obama.
We rate the statement Mostly False."
11,"""The U.S. now leads the world in producing both oil and natural gas, and at the same time reducing energy-related emissions.""","on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/aug/27/rick-perry/rick-perrys-claim-about-energy-production-emission/,Half-True,Rick Perry,"Rick Perry's claim about energy production, emissions needs context | PolitiFact Texas","During a speech at the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Austin on Aug. 14, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the United States is on the right path when it comes to balancing energy needs with environmental concerns.
 
""The U.S. now leads the world in producing both oil and natural gas, and at the same time reducing energy-related emissions,"" said Perry, addressing attendees at the meeting. The council is a business-backed organization that writes model legislation for conservative lawmakers to enact in different states.
 
""That’s a story that all too often doesn’t get told,"" he said. ""Those 190-something countries that signed on to that Paris Accord, I tell them, ‘When you catch up with us about reducing emissions, then you come talk to me about joining.’""
 
Perry’s claim about energy production and emissions caught our eye. Is it possible that the United States could lead other countries on energy production and lead on reducing emissions?
 
Michael Webber, director of the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, said Perry’s claim about oil and gas production is accurate, but his comment on emissions could use some context.
 
""It’s exciting. Any way you slice that first statement, to my understanding, it is absolutely true,"" said Webber, an author and professor who specializes in energy and mechanical engineering. ""The second statement can be true, but boy, there’s a lot of nuance and caveats around this.""
 
Oil and gas production
 
We turned to the Energy Information Administration for international data on energy production. The EIA is an independent entity within the Department of Energy that produces data on energy use.
 
EIA spokesman Dennis Mesina declined to comment on Perry’s claim specifically, but provided available data on energy production and emission reductions from countries around the world.
 
One resource provided by Mesina showed that the United States produced more petroleum and natural gas — both independently and combined — than any other country in 2018.
 
In fact, the U.S. has led on natural gas production since 2011, when it surpassed Russia. In 2018, it surpassed Saudi Arabia in petroleum production, according to the EIA information.
 
But at the same time, the United States remained the largest energy consumer in 2018 and saw a 3.5% increase in consumption over the previous year, the fastest growth the country has seen in energy consumption in 30 years, according to an analysis of BP’s 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy.
 
This increase in demand was seen across the world, with China, the United States and India accounting for the most growth, according to the analysis.
 
But EIA administrator Linda Capuano said the nation’s energy industry is entering a ""transformational time"" in testimony before the U.S. House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee in February.
 
""After decades of the United States importing more energy than it exports, EIA now forecasts that our country will become a net energy exporter in 2020,"" she said, according to her prepared comments.
 
Regardless of this prediction, the latest available data shows that the United States produces more oil and natural gas than other countries, as Perry said.
 
Reducing energy-related emissions
 
The second part of Perry’s claim lacks specifics. He did not offer a baseline for comparison or timeline for his claim — is he looking at year-to-year emissions reductions? Is he looking at reductions over a five-year period?
 
We can look at different time periods to get a sense of progress, looking at shifts in the past five, 10 or 15 years. But we can also look at emission reductions that occurred during the time period in which the United States led on production of oil and gas, as Perry said in his claim. The U.S. has led on natural gas production since 2011, but has led on production of both gas and oil just since last year.
 
Shaylyn Hynes, Perry's press secretary, pointed to a report from the International Energy Agency that details the longterm trend of decreasing emissions and also projections for future emissions to decline. 
 
""The US leads the world in actual energy related emissions reductions by orders of magnitude compared to any other country since 2005,"" Hynes said in a statement. ""Yes-there have been ebbs and flows (as there were during multiple years under the Obama Administration) but the overwhelming trend is downward.""
 
Hynes is right that, in broad strokes, the United States has reported a downward trend in carbon dioxide emissions that has resulted in more carbon dioxide emissions by volume than other nations. But, there's a bit more context we need to consider.
 
""In the end, I think it is true,"" Webber said of Perry’s claim. ""But if I were teaching a class, I’d say that it isn’t that simple and we have more to discuss.""
 
The EIA pointed us to global emissions data the agency tracks, which looks at carbon dioxide emissions by country by year, from 1980 to 2016. Carbon dioxide makes up the largest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.
 
Using these figures we looked at how the United States has reduced emissions over periods of five, ten and fifteen years (using the most current year of 2016) and how the U.S. compares to other countries.
 

*From 2011 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 273.7 million metric tons, or a 5% reduction.
*From 2006 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 738.6 million metric tons, or a 12.5% reduction.
*From 2001 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 586.9 million metric tons, or a 10% reduction.

During each of these time periods, the United States made the largest reduction in million metric tons of carbon dioxide, but dozens of countries made larger reductions in terms of percentage.
 
Absolute figures are important to consider, but percentages offer a different perspective when comparing the United States to other nations, since they account for factors like population, economic standing and levels of energy production.
 
The EIA has not published emissions data from after 2016, but BP’s 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy includes figures up to 2018, which allows for an analysis of emission reductions since the United States has become a leader on both oil and natural gas production.
 
An aside here: BP has a disclaimer that states its data is ""not comparable to official national emissions data,"" but it is considered a reliable resource by industry experts.
 
From 2017 to 2018, when the United States became the leading producer of oil and natural gas, the country saw a 2.6% increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Globally, there was a 2% increase in emissions, the fastest growth the world has seen in seven years, according to the report.
 
Hynes pointed to a report from the EIA that forecasted future carbon dioxide emissions — although Perry's statement was limited to the present. The report predicted that these emissions would decline by 2.3% in 2019 and 0.5% in 2020. 
 
Our ruling
 
Perry said ""The U.S. now leads the world in producing both oil and natural gas, and at the same time reducing energy-related emissions.""
 
It’s true that the United States is the leading producer of both oil and natural gas as of 2018, but the second part of Perry’s claim needs more context.
 
When we step back and look at shifts over the past five, 10 and 15 years, the United States has reduced more total carbon dioxide emissions than other nations, but dozens of others made more reductions in percent-terms.
 
From 2017 to 2018, the United States actually increased its carbon dioxide emissions.

We rate this claim Half True.

HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
Update: This piece was updated to include a comment and additional information provided by Shaylyn Hynes, Perry's press secretary. These additions did not affect the ruling."
11,"""We made a ridiculous deal (with Iran). We gave them $150 billion. We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing.""","on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-miscasts-money-and-terms-iran-nuclear/,Mostly False,Donald Trump,Donald Trump miscasts the money and the terms in the Iran nuclear de,"The G7 meeting closed with a possible sign of reduced tensions between Iran and the United States. After months of charges and counter charges, both President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani floated the idea of meeting with each other.
In May 2018, Trump pulled out of the multinational agreement that had rolled back Iran’s nuclear program and opened its facilities to international inspectors. 
In a post-G7 news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said the United States had ""made a ridiculous deal"" with Iran.
""We gave them $150 billion,"" Trump said Aug. 26. ""We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing.""
We’ve checked this before and on the numbers, the $150 billion is sketchy at best, while the $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. But it’s important to remember that however much money was involved, it started out as Iran’s. It had been frozen by sanctions since 1979. 
As for whether the United States ""got nothing"" from the deal, that view puts a value of zero on rolling back Iran’s nuclear program, which the agreement accomplished.
The $150 billion
The 2015 agreement, promoted by then President Barack Obama, freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. Called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal included Iran and the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. 
The agreement only affected sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear program. Iran has other frozen assets that were untouched by the deal.
Some conservatives have put the amount released as high as $150 billion, which is the highest of estimates we have seen. Another estimate from Iran’s Central Bank topped out at about $29 billion in readily available funds, with another $45 billion tied up in Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of Iran’s Oil Ministry.
After talking with officials at Iran’s Central Bank, Nader Habibi, professor of economics of the Middle East at Brandeis University, told PolitiFact in 2018 that the actual total is between $25 billion and $50 billion.
In July 2015, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told lawmakers Iran would gain access to $56 billion.
Even though Trump said that ""we gave"" Iran the money, little of that money was under the control of the United States or any U.S. bank. Most of it, Habibi said, was in central and commercial banks overseas. Furthermore, it was Iran’s money to begin with, not a payment from any government to buy Iran’s cooperation.
The $1.8 billion
The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed the cash transfer of $1.7 billion in a 2018 report. 
That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, and it was never delivered.
As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount, which is a lot of money — but 25 years is a long time for interest to build up the balance.
Not nothing
Trump’s claim that we got ""nothing"" in return misses the point of the deal: blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb.
""We got major restrictions and intrusive transparency on Iran's nuclear program. Beyond being not ‘nothing,’ this is the entire reason why we put the sanctions on in the first place,"" Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told us in 2016. ""Reasonable people may disagree whether we got enough for the sanctions relief, but it wasn't nothing.""
""There’s a long list (of things we got), such that even the Israeli intelligence community has concluded that, for the duration of the deal, Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon,"" said George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Under the deal, Iran agreed to lose 97% of its stockpile of enriched uranium and give up 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, which are needed to enrich uranium. It also agreed to curb production of plutonium (the other element that can be used to build a bomb) and dismantle its one plutonium reactor.
To make sure Iran held up its end of the bargain, the deal also permitted international inspectors to ""implement continuous monitoring."" What that means and whether it was enough are up for debate.
Our ruling
Trump said that under the 2015 nuclear deal, the United States ""gave"" Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion, and ""got nothing"" for either.
The $150 billion — which was not a gift, but an unfreezing of Iran’s assets — is the highest estimate we've seen, and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower.
The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion. 
As for ""getting nothing"" out of the deal, while some people will disagree that the United States got enough, it prevented Iran from getting enough fuel to build a bomb and allowing international inspectors. That’s more than nothing.
The official record backs up just one out of the three elements in Trump’s statement. We rate this Mostly False."
11,"""Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student.""","on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/27/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-south-carolina-spends-more-pr/,Mostly True,Bernie Sanders,Bernie Sanders is right that South Carolina spends more on prisons than schools,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., accused South Carolina of spending too much on prisons and not enough on schools, keying in on the issues of mass incarceration and education with an eye toward the early primary state.
""Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student,"" Sanders wrote in an Aug. 26 post. ""We should be investing in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.""
South Carolina’s situation is not unique. Across the country, states spend more on average to lock people up than to educate students.
Sanders may have focused on the Palmetto State because its Feb. 29 Democratic primary vote represents the first real test case of candidates’ strength with black voters, who cite criminal justice and education as critical issues. In 2016, Sanders lost the African American vote to Hillary Clinton by an astonishing 50 percentage points.
Sanders’ numbers checked out. But the gap between South Carolina’s spending on prisons and schools is nowhere near the biggest disparity among the states. 
A reflection of priorities
Sanders is correct: South Carolina spent an average of $21,756 on each of its roughly 20,000 inmates in 2018, according to a South Carolina Department of Corrections budget sheet that Sanders’ campaign referred us to. 
During the 2017-18 academic year, the Palmetto State spent an average of $11,525 per student. That data comes from the National Education Association’s annual assessment, which Sanders’ campaign pointed us to. 
That’s a difference of about $10,000 more on prisons than schools.
We heard from a South Carolina Department of Corrections official who pushed back against Sanders’ claim, saying that comparing inmate cost-per-year versus students ""is not an apples to apples comparison.""
""Inmate cost includes 24-hour care, housing, clothing, feeding, medical care, mental health care, programming, 24-hour security, plus education costs,"" the spokesperson said.
But other experts we spoke to said the comparison is a reasonable way to gauge a state’s priorities. 
""It’s hard to argue that spending twice as much on prisons as on schools doesn’t reflect some distorted priorities,"" said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. ""By international standards, the U.S. has an inordinate number of people in prison, and by international standards is underinvesting in education.""
The disparity between prison and school spending is not unique to South Carolina — in fact, it’s the same across the country. We compared the most recent data on state prison spending from the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice think tank, with state-by-state public school expenditures from the National Education Association. 
Every state averaged more spending on inmates than students, based on the available data from 2015, which included 45 states. On average, these states spent $11,709 per student, and $33,274 per inmate, or nearly three times more on prisons than schools.
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
Among the states we compared, South Carolina had the ninth lowest disparity between inmate and student spending.
If Sanders had wanted to highlight the largest disparity — $53,497 — he should have turned to deep blue California. In 2015, Sacramento spent an average of nearly $65,000 per prisoner, almost double the statewide average. That same year, California spent close to the statewide average on education per pupil, just over $11,000. 
""I think this is generally a reasonable comparison of state priorities,"" said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project. ""In many states spending on corrections has increased at a far higher rate than for education over the past several decades.""
Our ruling
Sanders said, ""Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student.""

11,"""89,000 children were separated from their parents under Obama"" and ""only 1,900 children have been separated under Trump.""","on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/27/facebook-posts/facebook-post-makes-inaccurate-comparison-family-s/,False,Facebook posts,"ebook post makes inaccurate comparison of family separations under Trump, Obama | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","A Facebook post falsely claims that a significantly higher number of children were separated from their parents during the Obama administration than under President Donald Trump’s administration.
""Did you know 89,000 children were separated from their parents under Obama? ONLY 1,900 children have been separated under Trump. This PERFECTLY exposes the bias of the media,"" said the Facebook post from Aug. 25, with nearly 400 shares.
""Good to know,"" wrote one commenter.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post doesn’t specifically say ""immigrant"" children — but the national discussion on separated families has centered on children and parents separated at the southwest border as a consequence of Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. The policy called for the prosecution of immigrants who crossed the border illegally; when adults came in with children, they were separated by immigration officials. Children were transferred over to the care of Health and Human Services Department, and adults taken into federal custody for prosecution.
Generally, under Trump and other administrations, immigration officials separate a child from an adult under three conditions: when authorities cannot establish the custodial relationship, when they believe that the custodian may be a threat to the child, or when the custodian is being detained for prosecution.
Immigration experts have told PolitiFact that immigrant family separations at the border during the Obama years did not happen at the scale that have under Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy.
In November, Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, told PolitiFact that the Obama administration did not count the number of families separated.
We don’t know where the Facebook post got its 89,000 figure. It’s possible that it’s a reference to a different set of children — children who arrived at the border alone without a parent or a guardian rather than those separated from their parents.
A 2016 Senate subcommittee report said that since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, Health and Human Services had placed almost 90,000 unaccompanied immigrant children with sponsors in the United States. ""According to HHS, it places the majority of those (unaccompanied alien children) with the child’s parent or legal guardian,"" the report said.
Overall, family separations did not happen under the Obama administration as a result of a ""zero-tolerance"" policy like Trump’s, despite Trump’s false claims that both presidents ""had the exact same policy.""
The total number of children separated from their parents under Trump’s administration is unclear because of faulty record-keeping. In June 2018, officials said that at least 2,342 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9 of 2018 as a result of the ""zero-tolerance"" policy.
Under a court order, around 2,800 children have been reunited with their parents or otherwise discharged from federal custody.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that ""89,000 children were separated from their parents under Obama"" and ""only 1,900 children have been separated under Trump.""
Immigration experts have told PolitiFact that family separations under Trump happened at a larger scale than they did under Obama. The Obama administration did not have a ""zero-tolerance"" policy that led to systematic family separations, as did Trump’s administration.
A spokeswoman for Homeland Security previously told PolitiFact that the Obama administration did not track the number of families separated. The Facebook post’s 89,000 number might be a reference to a number of children placed with sponsors during Obama’s administration — but those children arrived alone without a parent or guardian. That doesn’t mean they were separated from their parents.
The exact number of children separated under Trump is unclear, but based on previous data provided by Trump officials, the number at least surpasses 1,900.

11,"Says ""Muhammad owned many slaves"" while Robert E. Lee was ""against slavery.""","on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/27/facebook-posts/no-robert-e-lee-was-not-against-slavery-facebook-p/,False,Facebook posts,"No, Robert E. Lee was not ‘against slavery’ as Facebook post claims | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","As debate continues over the call to remove statues and monuments memorializing the Confederacy and its leaders, an eyebrow-raising claim about the army’s famous commander, Robert E. Lee, is circulating online. 
It says that Lee was ""against slavery"" – even though he commanded the army that fought to uphold the barbaric institution.
A viral Facebook post displays a painting of the Islamic prophet Muhammad next to an image of the Confederate commander with accompanying text that says:
""Muhammad owned many slaves. Robert E. Lee was against slavery. So why are we tearing down statues instead of mosques?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Yes, the prophet Muhammad owned slaves – but so did Lee.
Muhammad, who lived more than 1,000 years before Lee, reportedly taught that ""slaves were to be regarded as human beings with dignity and rights and not just as property, and that freeing slaves was a virtuous thing to do."" That said, Muslims in the 7th century, when Muhammad lived, still deemed slavery as legal.
So what about Robert E. Lee? 
According to an article posted by American Civil War Museum on its website, Lee personally owned slaves he inherited upon the death of his mother, Ann Lee in 1829. Then, in 1857, following the death of his father-in-law, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people working between two estates. Interestingly, Lee’s father-in-law specified in his will that all the family’s slaves be freed within five years of his death. 
But Sean Kane, then the museum’s interpretation and programs specialist, reported that Lee, as executor of the will, ""drove his new-found labor force hard to lift those estates from debt,"" and concerned it would take longer than five years, ""petitioned state courts to extend his control of enslaved people."" That didn’t happen, as Lee freed them in accordance with the will in 1862 (and three days before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect). However, in response to the brutal workload during those last years, many of the slaves attempted to escape. 
""In 1859 Wesley Norris, his sister Mary, and their cousin, George Parks, escaped to Maryland where they were captured and returned to Arlington,"" the museum said. In a later testimony in 1866, Norris reportedly said they were immediately taken before Lee, whose punishment was ordering them to be tied up to receive 50 lashes each, excluding Norris’ sister, who got 20.  
Regardless of that account, historians continue to argue over Lee’s position on slavery. Some of Lee’s letters and post-war statements paint an ambiguous picture of a man with a lukewarm opposition to it, but his own actions, slave-owning practices and other statements contradict that position. 
One of the most prominent letters that Lee’s defenders point to is one he wrote to his wife on Dec. 27, 1856: ""In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages."" 
But he goes on to say that slavery was ""a greater evil to the white man than to the black race"" and ""while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former."" Lee wrote that African Americans were ""immeasurably better off"" in America than in Africa and that the ""painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race...""
PolitiFact reached out to Eric Foner, a Civil War historian and Columbia University professor, on the veracity of the claim. Foner referred us to a passage he wrote on Lee’s connection with slavery:
""During his lifetime, Lee owned a small number of slaves. He considered himself a paternalistic master but could also impose severe punishments, especially on those who attempted to run away. Lee said almost nothing in public about the institution. His most extended comment, quoted by all biographers, came in a letter to his wife in 1856. Here he described slavery as an evil, but one that had more deleterious effects on whites than blacks. He felt that the ‘painful discipline’ to which they were subjected benefitted blacks by elevating them from barbarism to civilization and introducing them to Christianity. The end of slavery would come in God's good time, but this might take quite a while, since to God a thousand years was just a moment. Meanwhile, the greatest danger to the ‘liberty’ of white southerners was the ‘evil course’ pursued by the abolitionists, who stirred up sectional hatred. In 1860, Lee voted for John C. Breckenridge, the extreme proslavery candidate (a more moderate southerner, John Bell, carried Virginia that year).""
""I would not say that this qualifies Lee as ‘against slavery,’"" Foner added in an email. 
John Reeves, author of ""The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee"" wrote a post on some of the most popular myths attributed to the general – the first being Lee’s opposition to slavery.
Reeves explains that after losing the war, Lee attempted to present himself as always being against slavery. In an interview after his surrender, Reeves says, Lee said that ""the best men of the south"" were eager to do away with it, and in a testimony in 1866 he had ""always been in favor of emancipation — gradual emancipation.""
But, as Foner said, Reeves writes that the historical record doesn’t support these statements, as Lee and his family owned and managed slaves for decades and benefited ""tremendously"" from the institution.
Our ruling
A Facebook post says that the prophet Muhammad owned many slaves while Robert E. Lee was against slavery.
Both men owned slaves. Meanwhile, Lee, besides serving as commander of the army that fought to uphold slavery, imposed harsh punishments when his slaves disobeyed and said he thought the ""painful discipline"" was necessary for the ""instruction of the race,"" and that the end of slavery would come when God willed it. 
While Lee made some mixed statements on his feelings toward slavery, his actions and political positions contradict that he opposed it. We rate this post False."

That’s because there’s no credible evidence supporting the idea that Coleman was killed after having an affair with Bill Clinton. In fact, the rumor was discredited as early as the 1992 presidential campaign. Here are the facts.
Susan Coleman, not Suzanne Coleman as the Facebook post says, was a former law student of Bill Clinton at the University of Arkansas. Clinton taught there after earning his law degree in 1973. Coleman committed suicide in 1977, according to numerous published reports. 
During the presidential election that year, a young conservative named David Bossie ""was dispatched to sniff around Bill Clinton’s sex life by the Republican operative Floyd Brown, the founder of Citizens United,"" according to a 2016 story in the Atlantic.
Bossie and a retired police officer named Jim Murphy were working for Brown as they tried to confirm Coleman shot herself ""following a love affair with her law professor, Bill Clinton, that left her pregnant,"" CBS reported, according to the Washington Post. 
Murphy and Bossie, who helped run Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, followed Coleman’s mother to an Army hospital in Georgia, according to CBS, and ""burst"" into the room where her husband was being treated for a stroke ""and began questioning the shaken mother about her daughter’s suicide."" 
CBS Evening News reported that the investigation stemmed from an anonymous letter mass mailed to news organizations but that Coleman’s family ""maintained there was no truth to this, and said reporters who had investigated the letter found it to be a nasty hoax,"" according to UPI. 
After reading a transcript of the CBS News report, then-president George H.W. Bush ordered his campaign to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Brown, ""the hard-ball political ad man who has gone from being seen as (an) asset to a liability,"" UPI reported.

11,Says President Donald Trump hasn’t condemned David Duke and Richard Spencer.,"on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/27/joe-biden/biden-wrong-when-he-says-trump-hasnt-condemned-dav/,Mostly False,Joe Biden,Biden wrong when he says Trump hasn’t condemned David Duke,"Joe Biden said that President Donald Trump has failed to condemn racist leaders like David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, and white nationalist Richard Spencer.
In a speech in Iowa Aug. 20, Biden said:
""David Duke, head of the Ku Klux Klan, former head of the Klan. When that group came out of the woods, the fields, carrying those torches he said, ‘That’s why we voted for Donald Trump.’ He said he would take the country back. The white nationalist, Richard Spencer, he hailed Trump. He said, ‘This is the white nationalism we have been looking for.’ Did you hear him condemn either one of those people? Ever utter a word of condemnation?""
Biden didn’t answer his own question, but he was clearly stating Trump hasn’t condemned either racist leader.
Biden accurately quoted Duke’s comments about Trump, and Spencer did hail Trump. 
But Biden exaggerates when he says Trump hasn’t condemned Duke at all.
Trump’s condemnation of Duke goes back decades, though sometimes Trump has been more forceful than other times. Trump has also criticized demonstrations in which Spencer participated. But then Trump also said that there were ""very fine people, on both sides"" at the Charlottesville, Va., march.
What Trump said about David Duke 
In 2016, we fact-checked a claim that ""Trump refuses to denounce the KKK."" We rated the statement Mostly False. 
The ad distorted Trump’s record by cherry picking one interview in which CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Trump about Duke in February 2016. Duke founded a Louisiana chapter of the KKK in 1974, but left in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence. Since then, Duke has been a noted white supremacist. 
Tapper asked Trump if he would condemn Duke and say that he didn’t want the vote of white supremacists.
Trump replied: ""Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong."" 
Trump later blamed a bad ear piece, saying he could barely hear the questions. In the days that followed, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a ""bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years.""
The Biden campaign pointed to that interview when we asked them for evidence to support Biden’s claim. The campaign also referred us to instances when Trump denied knowing anything about Duke or gave testy disavowals.
We found Trump denounced Duke years before his interview with Tapper.
In 1991, CNN’s Larry King asked Trump what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented.
Trump replied: ""I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States.""
In 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted Duke’s support. Trump also called Duke ""a bigot, a racist, a problem."" 
During his 2016 bid, Trump disavowed Duke, but it was not as strongly worded as some of his earlier rebukes.
In 2015, when asked about a quasi-endorsement by Duke, Trump replied that he wouldn’t want his endorsement. Asked if he would repudiate Duke, he replied: ""Sure, I would do that, if it made you feel better. I don’t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. Actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all of the candidates.""
In 2016, when asked about Duke’s endorsement of him, Trump said he wasn’t aware of it.
""I didn’t even know he endorsed me,"" he said. ""David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?""
Sometimes Trump sounded exasperated by the question.
""I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan,"" he said in a debate. ""I totally disavow David Duke. I’ve been doing it now for two weeks, ... you’re probably about the 18th person that’s asked me the question.""
What Trump said about events led by Spencer
We didn’t find any instance when Trump was asked to denounce Spencer by name. But Trump has criticized events where Spencer, the head of a white-identity think tank, played a key role.
In November 2016, a New York Times journalist asked Trump about a recent conference in Washington D.C. of people who pledged allegiance to Nazism. Trump said, ""Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn.""
At the conference, Spencer saluted supporters with, ""Hail Trump."" 
Spencer was one of the leaders behind the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017 where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her.
Trump’s statement on Aug. 12, 2017, cast blame on ""many sides"", detracting from his overall message condemning bigotry.
""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,"" he said. ""It's been going on for a long time in our country.""  
In the following days, Trump condemned bigotry and neo-Nazis and white nationalists. But in the same breath he also told reporters, ""You also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.""
In other instances, Trump has condemned hate groups or racism without singling out any racist leader.
Following the mass shooting in El Paso, Trump condemned the shooter, who he said posted a manifesto ""consumed by racist hate.""
Our ruling
Biden said Trump hasn’t condemned Duke and Spencer. That’s an exaggeration.
Trump didn’t condemn Duke when asked about him in an interview with Tapper on CNN in 2016. But decades before, he had clearly condemned the former KKK leader -- and he did so after the Tapper interview, too. Some of his disavowals have been brief.
We can’t find an example of Trump condemning Spencer by name or being asked to do so, but he has criticized gatherings where Spencer, a white nationalist, played a major role, including Charlottesville. 
But Trump has at times detracted from his own denunciation of racism. Most notably, Trump said there were ""very fine people, on both sides"" at the Charlottesville march. At other times his denunciations have seemed reluctantly made. But he has made them.
We rate this statement Mostly False."

The Washington Post wrote about this fast food rumor Aug. 9 after a college student’s tweet of the list went viral. It amassed nearly 250,000 retweets, helped partially by a quote tweet from Chrissy Teigen, a model and TV personality.
""So if you see me starting to get thinner and toned don’t ask me why,"" the original tweet reads.
Contributions don’t show Trump support
In a reply to his original tweet, the original poster, whose real name is Zuriel Sanders, linked to five webpages as evidence. None of them back up his claim that 12 restaurants are directly supporting Trump in 2020.
Two links are from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks political donations.
The first shows that Chick-Fil-A employees, owners or their family members donated $36,530 to candidates during the 2016 election, with the bulk of the money going to Republicans. But that’s money from the last election cycle, it went to all national politicians (not just Trump) and, as a note on the website states, none of that money was donated by the company itself.
The second link shows the top contributors in the food and beverage industry to candidates in 2019-2020. McDonald’s Corp. tops the list with $238,220, the majority of which has gone to Republicans. Waffle House, Inc. also made the top 10 with $68,950 going to Republicans and other conservatives.
McDonald’s did not respond to our request for comment. But a closer look at the company’s political contributions show that there’s no evidence to suggest it’s directly supporting Trump in 2020.
RELATED: Does a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase go to Trump re-election efforts? Not exactly
The Center for Responsive Politics does not have data to indicate that individuals and PACs associated with the company have donated to Trump so far this election cycle. Numbers from the 2016 election show that Hillary Clinton was the candidate with the most single contributions.
What the data do show about 2020 contributions is that the McDonald’s PAC has contributed $98,500 to federal candidates so far, with the lion’s share going to Republicans. None has gone to Trump so far, according to the Center’s data.
We looked at political contributions from the other 10 companies, and their associated PACs, listed in the Instagram post. We found that only one of them, Taco Bell’s TACO PAC, supported Trump in 2016. And only a PAC affiliated with Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns the energy drink Bang, has contributed money to Trump’s 2020 re-election, as we noted in a previous fact check.
Finally, Trump isn’t the top recipient of money from the food and beverage industry so far. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is.
News stories point to political leanings
The other three links the original tweeter included as evidence for his claim are three news stories. They speak to the political leanings of fast food restaurants’ owners and operators, but they don’t prove the claim that 12 companies are supporting Trump in 2020.
The first link is to an article from a site called The Cheat Sheet. It claims to reveal the political leanings behind several popular restaurant chains.
Chick-Fil-A, Pizza Hut, Waffle House, KFC, McDonald’s, Wendy’s and IHOP are conservative, the site says. As evidence, the article points to news reports about each company’s past political contributions, which have mostly gone to Republican candidates. But those stories don’t mention the companies’ PACs contributing to Trump directly.
A 2016 Eater story cited by the Cheat Sheet even says so:
""Restaurant PACs — at least those on Eater’s list — aren’t donating to Clinton or Trump. Instead, PACs tend to work for the best interests of the company as a whole,"" reads the story, which analyzed political contributions from PACs supported by Wendy’s, Chick-Fil-A and Yum! Brands (which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut), among others.

The second news link the tweeter shared comes from Food & Wine. It reported in 2016 that TACO PAC had ""maxed out its giving to the Trump campaign.""
As evidence, the article cited data from the Center for Responsive Politics. They show that TACO PAC gave $5,000 to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election cycle. That PAC has not contributed any money to federal candidates so far this cycle.
The last news story the tweeter linked to comes from Salon. It reported on five ""radically conservative fast food companies,"" which included Chick-Fil-A, Carl’s Jr. and Waffle House.
That article points to other media accounts and interviews with the company’s founders and executives that elucidate their views. For example, Salon wrote about how Chick-Fil-A President Dan Cathy has spoken out in support of the ""traditional family"" and operating by ""biblical principles,"" which echo conservative values.
But none of the stories cited prove that the companies in question are directly supporting Trump’s 2020 campaign.
Restaurants deny political endorsements
PolitiFact reached out to each of the companies listed in the original tweet, save Bang, which we fact-checked before. 
We rated as Mostly False the claim that the energy drink company gives a portion of each energy drink sale to Trump’s campaign. But the fact-check noted that Bang’s leaders have been outspoken in support of Trump and Bang’s parent company did make a donation to a pro-Trump super PAC this year.
Of the 11 companies we contacted, six responded. Here’s what they told us: 
Chick-Fil-A: ""Chick-Fil-A does not make political contributions. We don’t contribute to a (political action committee).""
IHOP: ""We’re about pancakes, not politics. IHOP as a brand is not involved in providing financial support to either side of the aisle.""
In-N-Out: ""At In-N-Out Burger, we have always taken pride in providing the freshest, highest quality food to all of our customers regardless of political party and, as such, we do not take a position on, nor support, individual political candidates.""
Olive Garden: ""We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.""
Pizza Hut: ""Pizza Hut does not make donations to presidential political campaigns, and we do not endorse any political parties or candidates. Pizza Hut has no involvement with or control over donations made by our franchisees, who are independent business owners and, like all Americans, are free to donate to or support whomever they wish.""
Taco Bell: ""Taco Bell Corp. does not make donations to presidential political campaigns and has no involvement with or control over donations made by franchisees. Our franchisees are independent business people and, like all Americans, are free to donate to or support whomever they wish.""
While it’s true that most of the companies named in the Instagram post have contributed money to PACs in the past, including those that mostly support Republicans, we found no evidence that all of them have donated or endorsed 2020 candidates directly. Only Bang’s parent company has contributed to a pro-Trump PAC so far.
Our ruling
An Instagram post claimed that 12 food companies are supporting Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.
Campaign contribution data show that, while many of their employees and affiliates give money to Republican candidates, none of the companies mentioned have donated to Trump’s re-election effort directly. One company is associated with a PAC that gave to the president in 2016, and one is associated with a PAC that has given to Trump during this election cycle. News stories speak to the companies’ political views and past contributions, but they don’t prove support for Trump. Six companies denied making direct political contributions and/or endorsing presidential candidates.
The post is not accurate. We rate it False."

Allen James Frances, the chairman emeritus of Duke University’s department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, appeared on CNN’s ""Reliable Sources,"" a program hosted by Brian Stelter that analyzes the news media. 
Frances – who played a key role in the publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the reference work that defines recognized psychiatric conditions – was brought on the show to discuss how the media should cover those who question Trump’s mental fitness for office.
Frances warned against ""medicalizing politics,"" but he expressed concern about Trump:
""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person.""
After some Twitter users attacked Frances for comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler of Germany, Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong of China – and criticized Stelter for allowing Frances’ comment to go unchallenged – Stelter took responsibility, citing technical difficulties that had distracted him during Frances’ comment.
Frances also elaborated on Twitter, saying he was referring to the future death toll from climate change, hastened by Trump’s policies:
""Terrible damage Trump is doing to world climate at this global warming tipping point may be irreversable/could kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades. Many of them our children & grandchildren & their children. This is an existential crisis for humanity.""
We decided to take a closer look at Frances’ original comment.
In interviews with PolitiFact, historians of the 20th century and experts on climate change both agreed that Frances made an extraordinarily flawed comparison to put Trump in the company of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
""Much as I abhor Trump’s climate policies, calling him Hitler seems inappropriate to me,"" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor of earth system science. ""Trump’s climate and environmental policies are destructive. Calling him Hitler, though, is a distraction. It helps him marginalize criticism.""
""Frances’s statement is shockingly stupid and uninformed for someone with a respectable and responsible position,"" said Benjamin Hett, a historian at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and author of ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic.""
Frances did not respond to inquiries for this article. A spokesman for Duke said that Frances is retired from the university and has no current responsibilities. 
How many people did Hitler, Stalin, and Mao kill?
The death toll for each of the three 20th century dictators is subject to some disagreement and  margin of error, but authoritative accountings suggest that each was responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million or more.
Yale University historian Timothy Snyder estimated in 2011 that Hitler caused between 11 million and 12 million deaths of noncombatants, and that Stalin caused a similar number if you include deaths from disease and famine. 
Meanwhile, one calculation by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimated more than 17 million deaths caused by Hitler. Combat deaths from World War II, would push the number higher still. (Since Hitler and Stalin faced off in World War II, there’s a risk of double-counting in such calculations.)
Mao, for his part, may have exceeded them both.
Ian Johnson, the author of ""The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao,"" estimated in 2018 that Mao was responsible for perhaps 42.5 million deaths, of which the largest number came from a preventable famine stemming from his Great Leap Forward policy.
How many deaths could result from climate change?
A 2014 World Health Organization analysis found that ""climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050,"" from such varied causes as heat exposure to the elderly, diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition.
Using the 250,000-a-year figure, it would take about 40 years of Trump-related deaths from climate change to meet the low end of the Hitler and Stalin death counts. To reach Mao’s death toll of 42.5 million, it would take 170 years. 
In early 2019, Andy Haines and Kristie Ebi, environmental and health specialists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the WHO calculation ""a conservative estimate"" in a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine.
But even if the WHO estimate is low, it’s clear that you’d have to stick Trump with the blame for many decades worth of global deaths from climate change to compete with Hitler, Stalin or Mao.
Is Trump solely at fault for climate change?
Even experts who decry Trump’s climate policies note that any future deaths will not be solely attributable to him. 
The process has been underway long before Trump entered the Oval Office. In addition, countless other factors – from corporate policies to individuals’ own actions – have brought us to where we are today. 
""When Trump took office, we were already committed to the ocean and atmospheric warming that we are seeing now, the basically irreversible acceleration in polar ice melt we are seeing now, the accelerating melt of permafrost and its effects we are seeing now, and the accelerating sea level rise we are seeing now,"" said Harold R. Wanless, a professor of geography and regional studies at the University of Miami.
Given this, Wanless said, the blame should be shared with all preceding administrations and congresses since about 1979, ""when it became apparent that climate change was happening, was starting to produce these changes, was basically irreversible, and would be made worse and worse as we added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."" 
Wanless termed Frances’ comparison ""naïve, irresponsible, and purely political.""
Peter Fritzsche, a University of Illinois historian, told PolitiFact that ""it seems silly to find a single embodiment to the problem of climate change,"" he said. ""Trump is a poster boy of ignorance, but the problem is much much larger, more serious, more difficult.""
Fritzsche suggested a different comparison – presidents such as Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan whose inaction made the Civil War inevitable.
""I would compare Trump to the weak presidents of the 1850s who completely failed to see -- purposefully -- the conflict between North and South, the expansion of slavery in the West, and the issue of fugitive slaves,"" he said.
Our ruling
Frances said, ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.""
Not only does Frances’ comparison exaggerate the predicted climate change death toll compared to that of the dictators, he also lays the blame for potential future deaths at Trump’s feet alone, which even experts critical of Trump consider wrongheaded. We rate the statement Pants on Fire."
11,"A federal pilot program to DNA test illegal immigrants showed ""something like 30% (of test subjects) are fake families.""","on Monday, August 26th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/26/ken-cuccinelli/trump-administration-using-dna-tests-crack-down-fa/,Half-True,Ken Cuccinelli,The Trump administration is using DNA tests to crack down on “fake families” at the border,"Fearing that children were being smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration has sought to detect instances where adult migrants fraudulently present unrelated children as their own. 
So earlier this year, the administration rolled out a pilot program to DNA test some groups apprehended at the border who purported to be family units, as a way to determine if they are in fact related.
According to the acting director of the office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, nearly a third of suspicious cases were found to reveal fraudulent families.
""You've undoubtedly heard about the pilot programs with the Border Patrol where they're doing DNA testing,"" Cuccinelli told at the Texas Public Policy Foundation Aug. 22, 2019. ""They're identifying fake families. In the areas where those are being implemented, it's something like 30% are fake families.""
While the DNA testing program uncovered cases of migrant groups lying about being families, the federal data we found showed the rate of fraudulent families was lower than Cuccinelli’s figure. 
DNA pilot program
The pilot DNA testing program Cuccinelli referred to was carried out earlier this year by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Officials said the rapid DNA tests, administered through cheek swabs, were done on a voluntary basis. Results take about 90 minutes to produce.
Before rapid DNA testing, officials relied on more traditional investigative means to suss out fraudulent families, like screening documents for counterfeits. Using such methods, agents detected more than 1,000 instances of fraudulent families attempting to cross the Southern Border from October 2018 through April of this year, according to the Washington Post. 
During a three-day pilot operation from May 8-10, DNA testing revealed a portion of the groups caught crossing the border illegally had lied about being related. But the rate was not as high as 30%, as Cuccinelli said.
According to an ICE statement in June, agents tested 84 family units who ""presented indicia of fraud."" Of those, 16 groups claiming to be a family were identified as fraudulent. That’s a rate of 19%.
The June ICE statement also said the agency would extend the pilot program by 120 days, and expand it to five additional border locations beginning later that month. However, we found no data showing the results of the extended pilot program. 
Homeland Security did not respond or provide data when asked. The office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — under Cuccinelli’s charge — did not respond to our request, either. 
It’s not entirely clear where Cuccinelli’s 30% figure comes from. 
The Associated Press reported on May 1 that ""ICE officials said they have identified 101 possible instances of fraudulent families since April 18 and determined one-third were fraudulent."" But that report was published prior to the rollout of the DNA pilot program that began May 8.
About a week after phase one of the pilot program ended in May, the Washington Examiner on May 18 reported the 30% figure, citing an anonymous ""official involved in the system's temporary rollout."" 
""Approximately 30% of rapid DNA tests of immigrant adults who were suspected of arriving at the southern border with children who weren't theirs revealed the adults were not related to the children, an official involved in the system's temporary rollout who asked to be anonymous in order to speak freely told the Washington Examiner,"" the newspaper’s May 18 report stated.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also cited the 30% figure during a July 14 appearance on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures.
""Thirty percent of the people with small children are fake families,"" he told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo. 
Graham’s office indicated the senator had not been describing the results of the DNA pilot program. Rather, he was referring to data about fake families that was collected prior to the DNA testing.
Our ruling
Cuccinelli said a federal pilot program to DNA test illegal immigrants showed ""something like 30% (of test subjects) are fake families.""
It’s not entirely clear where Cuccinelli’s 30% figure comes from. 
The Associated Press reported that in the latter half of April, border officials identified around 100 possible cases of fraudulent families, and found that one third were fraudulent. But these findings were based on traditional investigative methods like document screening, and happened before the DNA testing program went into effect.  
An article in the Washington Examiner published on May 18 — about a week after phase one of the DNA pilot program ended — reported the 30% statistic, citing an unnamed immigration official. 
But in June, the ICE released data that showed around 20% of suspicious cases turned up DNA evidence that disproved a family relationship. The relevant agencies did not respond to our request for information.

11,"Says 194 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018 while undocumented immigrants killed 83,211 people.","on Monday, August 26th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/26/facebook-posts/post-comparing-mass-shooting-deaths-homicides-undo/,False,Facebook posts,st comparing mass shooting deaths to homicides by undocumented immigrants way off | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"A viral post circulating on Facebook claims that, in 2018, tens of thousands more people died at the hands of undocumented immigrants than those killed in mass shootings.
The Aug. 15 post has been shared over 7,000 times and says: 
""Number of people killed in mass shootings in 2018 = 194 … Number of people killed by illegal immigrants in 2018 = 83,211.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This very specific, unsourced post is inaccurate, for several reasons.
First, there is no universally accepted definition of a mass shooting. 
The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, are shot and/or killed in the same location, at roughly the same time. 
Based on that definition, the organization reported that 372 people were killed from 338 mass shootings that occurred in the country in 2018. That’s almost twice as many as the claim states.
If you go by the crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project, which goes by the looser mass shooting definition of four or more people shot in one incident, including the shooter, 2018’s count goes up to 528 deaths from 426 mass shootings.

Or take Mother Jones’ findings, which uses the government’s more conservative mass shooting designation: A single attack in a public place in which three or more victims are killed. This definition dramatically lowers the numbers, eliminating all shootings in which victims are only injured. Based on the stricter classification, Mother Jones reported there were 12 mass shootings in the U.S. in 2018 that took the lives of 80 people. 
Regardless of how you look at it, the first half of the post is off – it’s either too high, or far too low. 
So what about the part that claims 83,211 people were killed by undocumented immigrants in 2018? That’s also inaccurate.
First, there isn't a national database tracking how many people are killed by immigrants who are in the country illegally. But even without that data, it’s clear that this figure is wildly out of the ballpark of what could be considered a reasonable estimate.
In 2017, the estimated number of total murders in the United States was 17,284, a 0.7% decrease from the 2016 estimate, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. And according to the agency’s preliminary 2018 report, there appears to be an overall decrease in violent crime in the country:
""Preliminary figures indicate that law enforcement agencies throughout the nation showed an overall decrease of 4.3 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention for the first 6 months of 2018 when compared with figures reported for the same time in 2017.""
The final 2018 crime statistics report hasn’t been released yet, so it is unlikely the post is based on anything credible. But even without having those numbers available, we know that the U.S. experiences an average of roughly 17,000 murders each year, and that includes those committed by legal citizens. It is therefore impossible that immigrants alone would have been responsible for the murders of more than 83,000 people in 2018.
Moreover, according to the Cato Institute, which describes itself as a ""public policy research organization – a think tank – dedicated to the principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets and peace,"" immigrants have a lower criminal incarceration rate than native-born Americans:
""All immigrants have a lower criminal incarceration rate and there are lower crime rates in the neighborhoods where they live, according to the near-unanimous findings of the peer-reviewed evidence.  Since 1911, large nationwide federal immigration commissions have asked whether immigrants are more crime-prone than native-born Americans and each one of them answered no, even when the rest of their reports unjustifiably blamed immigrants for virtually every problem in the United States.  From the 1911 Immigration Commission, also known as the Dillingham Commission, to the 1931 Wickersham Commission, and 1994’s Barbara Jordan Commission, each has reported that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.""
The organization also looked at Texas, the only state that tracks crimes committed by immigration status, in a 2018 study and found that, in 2015, ""the criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born Americans. Moreover, the conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans. This result holds for most crimes.""
Our ruling
A viral Facebook post claims that 194 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018, while 83,211 were killed by undocumented immigrants.
The post appears to be entirely fabricated – neither part of the claim checks out. 
Estimates for mass shooting fatalities in 2018 range from 80 to 528, depending on the reporting organization and how they each define a ""mass shooting."" But no estimates come close to the 194 figure. As well, according to the FBI, roughly 17,000 murders occur in the U.S. each year, so 83,211 people being killed by specifically undocumented immigrants in one year is improbable.

""A gas powered van, towing a diesel generator, charging an electric car. The future is stupid,"" reads the text above the photo.
Shared on Facebook more than 74,000 times since Aug. 11, the image garnered over 770 comments.
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
That’s because the narrative being shared about what is happening in the photo isn’t right. While the van in the photo is diesel-powered (not gas), it is towing a battery pack, not a diesel generator. 
A reverse-image search revealed that the yellow van comes from a roadside assistance company in Austria called OAMTC. 
The company initially posted the photo on its Facebook page on May 29, 2019, with the caption: 
""If the battery can't make it anymore, we'll bring you fresh juice! Our ‘Mobile Power Bank’ for e-cars has successfully completed its first test in practice. After about 20 minutes, the electric Mercedes had enough power to bring our member to the next charging station without any problems. We think this is pretty electrifying!""
Our attempts to reach someone with OAMTC went unanswered, but we’re not the first to check this claim. An OAMTC member told fact-checkers at AFP that the photo was ""wrongly interpreted, this is not a portable generator, but a mobile power bank for electric cars."" The power bank, AFP reported, is made of lithium battery packs that can provide electricity for an electric vehicle for about 12 kilometers (or about 7.5 miles).
AFP found that the packs can charge from any energy source in OAMTC’s shops, and according to the World Bank, 76% of Austria’s electricity output came from renewable sources in 2015.
And though the Facebook post says the van is gasoline-powered and towing a diesel generator (the lithium battery pack), it is actually the van that is diesel-powered, according to OAMTC officials.
While diesel engines do create harmful emissions, they are generally considered more fuel efficient compared to their gasoline counterparts and emit less carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide than gasoline combustion. 
Our ruling
An image shared on Facebook comes with the claim that a gas-powered van is towing a diesel-powered generator that is charging an electric car.
The only oil-based product in the photo is the van, which runs on diesel. In tow is a mobile lithium battery pack used to charge stranded electric vehicles.

""Do you have an emergency or not?"" the dispatcher in the ad says.
""Yes,"" the woman replies.

11,"""Elected officials draw (legislative redistricting) maps. That’s it.""","on Friday, August 23rd, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/aug/23/adam-jarchow/former-wisconsin-rep-misses-mark-redistricting-cla/,False,Adam Jarchow,rmer Wisconsin rep. misses mark on redistricting claim | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"Skewed maps orchestrated by Wisconsin Republicans after the 2010 Census drew numerous legal challenges but survived to give the GOP a stranglehold on the state Legislature.
With the 2020 Census looming, redistricting is again a hot topic, particularly for the Democrats who garnered more statewide votes but claimed just over one-third of the Assembly seats last fall.
Opponents of gerrymandering proposed in July 2019 to have the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau draw the maps without giving an advantage to either party. Republican leaders who control the state Legislature have said the bill is going nowhere.
But that proposal prompted a Twitter exchange that caught our eye.
Former state Rep. Adam Jarchow, R-Balsam Lake, retweeted coverage of the proposal July 16, 2019, calling it ""non-sense"" and insisting elected officials should draw maps. When another user asked if he felt gerrymandering is an issue, the two-term lawmaker responded:
""My answer is the same as it’s been for 250 years in this country. Elected officials draw maps. That’s it. If people don’t like how they drew them, kick them out of office.""
Hmm. Are elected officials really the only people who draw district maps in the U.S.? Or are there other ways to do it?
Given the attention on this issue will only grow in the coming year, we decided to check it out.
Gerrymandering 101
Wisconsin is currently a classic example of gerrymandering, or manipulating legislative boundaries for partisan gain. 
Amid one legal challenge to the maps, a federal court said the Wisconsin maps drawn in 2011 were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. We rated Mostly True a 2017 claim that Wisconsin was the most or second-most gerrymandered state in the country.  
After the 2010 Census, Republicans — who controlled all of state government — drew lines that created an out-sized number of GOP districts in a state that is otherwise pretty evenly divided between Democrat and Republican voters. The November 2018 election laid the disproportionate boundaries bare. 
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
 
Across the 99 elections for the state Assembly, Democrats garnered 53% of the votes, compared to 45% for Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. But that overall advantage yielded only 36 Democratic seats in the Assembly, compared to 63 for Republicans.
That’s because the GOP-imposed boundaries clustered Democratic voters together while Republicans wound up with smaller but hard-to-overcome majorities in other districts. The Democratic winners averaged 90% of the vote in Fall 2018, while Republican winners averaged 63%.
Meanwhile, a Marquette University Law School poll earlier this year found 72% of Wisconsinites support having a nonpartisan commission draw the maps — including a majority of both parties.
Most states have legislators draw boundaries, but not all
Wisconsin’s approach redistricting is the most common nationally, but it is far from the only option.
As of December 2018, state legislatures were responsible for drawing state district maps in 30 states, often subject to a veto by the governor. (Wisconsin is among those granting the governor veto power, which means the state Legislature may need a more cooperative approach than the all-GOP process that yielded the current maps.) Four of those states have a backup commission, however, that draws the maps if the Legislature deadlocks or the governor issues a veto. 
But that number is shrinking.
Redistricting reforms have put maps in the hands of a commission of some kind in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio and Utah since 2010, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law. 
New Hampshire passed a bill to move to an independent commission, but it was vetoed Aug. 9, 2019, by the Republican governor.
All told, 20 states now use some type of commission or nonpartisan agency to draft of state legislative maps. The commissions are often nominated by leaders of both parties. Some states give them final say, others make the commission’s maps subject to approval by the Legislature or governor.
Eleven states currently give the Legislature no direct role in drawing or approving the state legislative boundaries, according to the Brennan Center. That number will grow to 13 in 2021 when new laws in Ohio and Michigan take effect.

The breakdown is similar for how congressional districts are drawn, aside from the seven states that have only one district.
Jarchow did not reply to requests for evidence of his claim. An attorney in Polk County in northwestern Wisconsin, Jarchow left the state legislature in January 2019 after losing a special election for a state Senate seat and serving two terms in the Assembly.
‘Kick them out of office’
Jarchow concluded his claim with an oft-heard response to political criticism, that voters who don’t like it can elect for new lawmakers.
But that’s exceptionally difficult in a gerrymandered state.
""Even in wave election years you don’t see that much change,"" said Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel at Brennan. ""The whole point of gerrymandering is to make sure seats don’t flip, and we have proof from around the country that this works if you draw districts right.""
In 2018, only 28% of the congressional districts that flipped to another party nationwide were from states where maps were drawn by legislatures — even though the majority of states use that system.
Our ruling
Jarchow, a Republican, said amid a redistricting discussion that ""elected officials draw maps. That’s it.""
That’s simply not true.
State legislatures still draw the majority of maps around the country. But a growing number of states have turned to an independent or bipartisan commission of some kind to establish legislative boundaries.
Eleven states currently give the Legislature no direct involvement in drawing or approving maps.
We rate Jarchow’s claim False."

But a bill passed as part of H.R. 4310 — the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 — instead reversed restrictions on news programs funded by the U.S. government.
Let’s break this down.
First, Obama didn’t ""quietly"" sign H.R. 4310, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act, into law as the meme suggests. He issued a statement about its passing and about some provisions he didn’t agree with, though he didn’t list the Smith-Mundt modernization bill as part of his objections. 
So what did the legislation actually do?
H.R. 4310 and the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012
H.R. 4310, otherwise known as the National Defense Authorization Act, authorized Pentagon funding through fiscal year 2013. 
As part of H.R. 4310, the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 also passed and removed restrictions on programming produced by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the U.S. government’s broadcasting arm. 
Some of these programs include Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. 
Many have criticized the programs and dubbed the content propaganda, while the organizations say they adhere to strict journalistic standards and aim to educate populations that come from parts of the world where freedom of speech is suppressed. 
For example, Voice of America says it broadcasts ""accurate, balanced and comprehensive reporting, programming, online and social media content for a global audience, particularly to those who are denied access to open and free media,"" and it defines the legally mandated standards in the VOA journalistic code.
""An essential guarantee of the journalistic credibility of Voice of America content is the ‘firewall’ enshrined in the 1994 U.S. International Broadcasting Act,"" the website says. ""The firewall prohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news, thereby safeguarding the ability of our journalists to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of journalism, free of political interference.""
Before the act was passed, the programs could only be viewed or listened to at broadcast quality in foreign countries. The bill removed restrictions on domestic distribution. 
A contemporaneous report by Foreign Policy, a news organization that covers global affairs, detailed what the bill did, along with why government officials say it was passed: 
""A former U.S. government source with knowledge of the BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) says the organization is no Pravda, but it does advance U.S. interests in more subtle ways. In Somalia, for instance, VOA serves as counterprogramming to outlets peddling anti-American or jihadist sentiment. ‘Somalis have three options for news,’ the source said, ‘word of mouth, al-Shabab, or VOA Somalia.’
This partially explains the push to allow BBG broadcasts on local radio stations in the United States. The agency wants to reach diaspora communities, such as St. Paul, Minnesota’s significant Somali expat community. ‘Those people can get al-Shabab, they can get Russia Today, but they couldn’t get access to their taxpayer-funded news sources like VOA Somalia,’ the source said. ‘It was silly.’
Lynne added that the reform has a transparency benefit as well. ‘Now Americans will be able to know more about what they are paying for with their tax dollars — greater transparency is a win-win for all involved,’ she said..""
That doesn’t change the fact that the programs can be considered propaganda, but contrary to the Facebook post’s claim, the legislation did not repeal any law that prohibited independent and traditional media outlets in the private sector from publishing false information. It removed limitations on U.S.-funded and generated content from being aired in the country. 
For context, it’s important to note that post might sound like Obama changed libel laws in the country. But that’s not true, either. Libel laws vary state by state, and there isn't a federal libel law.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims Obama made it legal for the media to ""purposely lie to the American people"" when he signed H.R. 4310 into law in 2012, ""allowing propaganda to be used on the citizens of the USA by its own government, essentially repealing the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, banning the use of domestic propaganda.""
Obama did sign H.R. 4310 into law, also passing the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. But the bill did not make it legal for independent, private-sector media outlets to present outright false information to the public. Instead, it allowed government-sponsored news like Voice of American to be broadcast in the United States. It removed restrictions on U.S.-generated news from being presented to American audiences.  
The claim is not accurate. We rate it False."
12,"Says ""Dan Bishop doubles down on removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Under his sham ‘association health plans,’ insurance companies don't have to pay for medications for pre-existing conditions.""","on Thursday, August 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2019/aug/23/dan-mccready/mccready-tells-half-story-about-bishops-health-bil/,Half-True,Dan McCready,McCready tells half the story about Bishop's health bill | PolitiFact North Carolin,"A North Carolina Democrat is accusing his Republican opponent of supporting health-care policies that don’t offer protection for people with pre-existing conditions.
That Democrat is Dan McCready, who’s running for Congress in NC’s 9th district against state Sen. Dan Bishop of Mecklenburg County. The district is Republican-leaning, but the race is considered close leading up to the Sept. 10 election.
McCready recently put health care coverage at the forefront of his campaign, highlighting legislation Bishop sponsored as an example of how the Republican would fail to protect North Carolinians.
""Sen. Dan Bishop doubles down on removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,"" McCready tweeted on Aug. 8, adding ""Under (Bishop’s) sham ‘association health plans,’ insurance companies don’t have to pay for medications for pre-existing conditions.""
What is McCready talking about? His tweet provided a link to a Winston-Salem Journal story about the Small Business Health Care Act, also known as Senate Bill 86. The bill was recently passed by the legislature and sent to Gov. Roy Cooper for approval.
We looked into the details of the bill and found McCready has a point about insurers being able to offer skimpy coverage as part of the proposed new health plans, but his claim about ""removing coverage"" for people is an exaggeration.
What are association health plans?
At the federal level, Bishop has stated that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which protects people with pre-existing conditions. Bishop has said he wants to replace it with something better.
At the state level, Bishop sponsored SB 86. The bill aims to provide coverage for small businesses, trade associations and other groups of professionals who are in the same industry or line of work through what’s called an ""association health plan."" President Donald Trump in 2017 signed an executive order expanding the availability of these plans as a way of providing an alternative option who can’t afford ACA plans.
People who work for associations and other small businesses sometimes can’t offer their employees insurance because they struggle to find plans that are affordable. This bill would enable insurers to offer coverage plans to these groups that might be cheaper than ACA plans because they’re not required to provide as much coverage.
Bishop’s bill explicitly states that association health plans would be subject to the ACA’s ""group health plan"" requirements, which means insurers ""cannot deny individuals coverage if they have preexisting conditions, cannot impose annual and lifetime limits on certain benefits, and must provide free access to certain preventative services.""
But that doesn’t mean that people with pre-existing conditions would be guaranteed coverage for services they need.
‘Essential benefits’
There’s more than one way to deny coverage to people, said Valerie Lewis, an associate professor of health policy and management at UNC’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. Allowing insurers to discriminate at the time of enrollment is just one way, she said.
""The other way is to allow anyone to join or purchase the plan, but to have the plan provide a very limited set of benefits,"" she said in an email.
That’s what health policy experts say could happen under Bishop’s bill. While the ACA requires plans to cover 10 ""essential benefits"" — from prescription drugs and rehabilitative services to chronic disease management — association plans are subject to looser standards and aren’t required to cover those essential benefits, she said.
""As a simple example, you could allow people who have cancer to buy into the plan, but the plan might cover (pay for) zero cancer care — in effect removing coverage for the preexisting condition despite nominally allowing the person to purchase the insurance plan,"" Lewis said.
The Winston-Salem Journal story points out that Bishop’s bill ""does not include guarantees of the essential benefits. An amendment to add the essential benefits to SB86 was tabled by a 28-20 vote in the Senate,"" with Bishop voting to table it.
Under the version the legislature sent to the governor, ""employers could still choose between AHPs with somewhat more limited coverage and normal group insurance that has full coverage,"" said Mark Hall, Director of Health Law and Policy at Wake Forest University’s School of Law.
""So no group would be denied the option of full coverage,"" Hall said, emphasizing the word ""option."" But, people within a group could, and probably would, end up with less coverage for some of their pre-existing conditions.""
Other potential problems
After a year of insuring a group or association, an insurer could ""identify people whose claims are high"" and write the following year’s coverage plan to exclude their needs, said David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy.
Indeed, an association plan ""can be shaped so that it doesn’t attract people with certain conditions,"" said Kevin Lucia, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms for Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
But it’s also possible insurers craft plans in order to attract people, Hughes Waren, a leader of the NC Association of Health Underwriters, told North Carolina Health News. If the associations include high-income workers, he said the associations may be incentivized to seek plans with decent benefits.
""I would have no reason to think that anybody is doing these to offer skinny plans. It’s really to provide a benefit to their members,"" Waren told NC Health News. ""They’re going to create competitive plans that are attractive.""
There’s one more factor to consider. If healthy people leave their ACA plan for an association health plan, people with ACA plans could face higher premiums the following years because there won’t be as many people to share the cost burden. Customers with pre-existing conditions are likely to be the most affected.
Our ruling
McCready said Bishop supported ""removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.""
That wording could give the impression that this bill directly and immediately strips health care coverage from people with pre-existing conditions. That’s not the case.
But experts point out that insurers aren’t required to offer association health plans with a full range of services for people with pre-existing conditions. The proliferation of association health plans could also affect people with pre-existing conditions on ACA plans. McCready’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate his claim Half True.

""Since the passage of Tax Cuts, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205,"" Ivanka Trump tweeted on Aug. 20.
Fact: Thanks to pro-growth policies of this Administration, Americans are earning more. Since the passage of Tax Cuts, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205 and the lowest wage earners have seen the fastest nominal wage growth (8.9%)!— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) August 20, 2019 
Vice President Mike Pence had tweeted something similar a day earlier.
For most Americans, $5,000 more in their pocket should be noticeable. So is the talking point accurate?
Federal data does back up the number -- but you can be forgiven if you’re wondering where your extra $5,000 is. The figure being touted by the White House is an average, and your take may be much, much lower than that.
Where does the number come from?
The earliest source of this figure comes from a July 31 tweet from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers. It said, ""Thanks in part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and other pro-growth policies of @realDonaldTrump's Administration, Americans are earning more. Since the passage of the #TCJA in December 2017, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205 as of June 2019!""
Thanks in part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and other pro-growth policies of @realDonaldTrump's Administration, Americans are earning more. Since the passage of the #TCJA in December 2017, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205 as of June 2019!— CEA (@WhiteHouseCEA) July 31, 2019 
We made several inquiries to the White House to confirm the methodology the Council of Economic Advisers used, but they did not respond.
So we looked at publicly available data from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
On a per-capita basis, inflation-adjusted disposable personal income rose from $43,414 to $45,473 between the 4th quarter of 2017 (the last quarter before the tax cuts) and the 2nd quarter of 2019 (the most recent quarter for which data is available). That’s a difference of $2,059.
However, Ivanka Trump’s tweet, talked about ""per household"" personal income, while the data on the BEA website calculates it per person.
We were able to adjust this calculation by multiplying the figure by 2.5, which is the approximate number of people in the average household. That produces a final dollar increase of $5,148, which is close to what Ivanka Trump tweeted.
What the statistic doesn’t tell you
Mathematically, then, the figure is basically accurate. However, it would be wrong to assume that a typical American is $5,000 richer today. Here’s why.
It’s an average. The increase of $5,000 is a national average, rather than a median, so there will be a wide variation in gains on a household-by-household basis. Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless offered an analogy featuring Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
""If Bill Gates walks into a room containing 99 destitute people, the average wealth of the people in the room will rise from $0 to $1 billion, even though the median wealth in the room remains unchanged at zero,"" he said.
In the case of the White House’s number, the large benefits accruing to a modest number of top earners boosts the size of the pie that produced $5,000 figure for disposable income gains. Not everyone should expect to have seen their income go up by that much.
It’s partly driven by lower tax bills. It’s worth remembering that at least some portion of the increase in disposable income comes from the tax cuts themselves, rather than from the economic growth they have spurred. 
""Gains in disposable real income are positive news,"" Burtless said. ""The news would be even more positive if we knew the improvement also reflects faster gains in the pre-tax real incomes of middle- and lower-income families. That’s because the tax cuts for those families are supposed to gradually fall to zero.""
Income has been on the rise, starting under Obama. The performance under Trump does exceed the improvement seen under the final seven quarters of Barack Obama’s presidency – $1,082 under Obama compared with the $5,148 under Trump. But again, it’s worth noting that Obama was not cutting taxes significantly during his final year and a half in office, while Trump was cutting them in the period Ivanka Trump noted.
The following chart suggests that the trend line for inflation-adjusted, per-capita disposable personal income has been on a fairly consistent upward path since early 2013, or about four years before Obama left office.

Our ruling
Ivanka Trump said, ""Since the passage of Tax Cuts, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205.""
Mathematically, the number is accurate, but it’s worth noting some context she left out. The $5,205 figure is an average, so it is likely skewed by large gains among wealthier Americans. In addition, this statistic has been rising pretty consistently since early 2013, when Obama was in office, even during periods where it was not boosted by a large tax cut.
The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True."

12,"""We have something like one out of four young black men in this country end up in the criminal justice system. They may end up in jail, they may end up on parole, they may end up on probation.""","on Thursday, August 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/22/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-told-cardi-b-one-four-young-black-m/,Half-True,Bernie Sanders,Do one in four young black men ‘end up in the criminal justice system?’,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a new ally in his race for president: Cardi B.
In an interview with the Bronx, N.Y., rapper posted Aug. 15, the senator answered questions provided by Cardi’s nearly 50 million Instagram followers. Around one and a half minutes into the video, Cardi asked Sanders about police brutality.
""We constantly see on social media police brutality against black men and against minorities,"" she said. ""What are we going to do to change that? Because that is discouraging our people. We constantly see our men getting killed every day, and it seems like nobody cares, nobody’s sympathizing, nobody’s talking about it.""
Sanders said, ""We have something like one out of four young black men in this country end up in the criminal justice system. They may end up in jail, they may end up on parole, they may end up on probation.""

We hadn’t heard a one-in-four statistic exactly how Sanders said it, so we decided to check it out.
A Sanders campaign spokesperson sent us three sources: one Gallup poll from 2013, a 2003 report from the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and a 2018 report from the Sentencing Project, an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform.
Key findings
• None of those sources directly back up his claim, though they do speak to disparities in the treatment African Americans receive in the criminal justice system. 
• Our own research found that federal crime statistics don’t often include breakdowns by sex, age and race for adults. That makes it hard to tell how many ""young black men"" end up in the criminal justice system.
• Also complicating things is the imprecision of the phrase ""young black men."" It could refer to juveniles, or reasonably to men younger than 25, or 35. By talking about how one-in-four young black men end up in the system, did he mean while they were young — or their likelihood down the road?
The phrase ""end up in the criminal justice system"" is vague, said Candace McCoy, a professor in the Graduate Center's Department of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York.
An old study with worse findings
The best support for Sanders' claim is a 2003 report from the Justice Department — the second source the Sanders campaign sent us. 
The report estimated that black men born in 2001 had a 32.2% chance of going to prison during their lifetime, based on incarceration rates at the time. The likelihood was 11.3% for men overall.
That figure applied to black men of all ages, so we looked closer at the report for age-specific data. 
It estimated that about 681,000 black men aged 18-34 in 2001 had been incarcerated in state and federal prison during their lifetimes. Census data show there were about 4.3 million black men in that age group as of 2000, which would put the imprisonment rate at about 15.7%.
The one-in-three imprisonment stat is about 16 years old. But since 2003, imprisonment rates of black men have declined, lending more credence to what Sanders laid out, said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. 
""While there have been no updated analyses of how this affects the ‘one in three’ figure, it seems that ‘one in four’ is a reasonable, and conservative, estimate of the current situation,"" Mauer said.
Juvenile crime rates
Another way of reading Sanders' claim is to focus on how often black youth currently interact with the criminal justice system. We found that federal crime statistics for black juveniles put offense rates lower than what Sanders suggested.
According to a dataset maintained by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, there were an estimated 212,000 juvenile delinquency offenses, including probation, among black youth (mostly commonly defined as anyone 17 or younger) in 2017. 
U.S. Census data show that there were an estimated 5.25 million black men 17 or younger in 2017. That would put the offense rate for juvenile black men at around 8.7%.
Keep in mind, that doesn’t take into account the proportion of juveniles who end up in the criminal justice system — just the number of cases. 
Federal data lack age, sex breakdowns
There is other data that speaks to overrepresentation of the black population in the criminal justice system, though not exactly to what Sanders said.
Sanders’ campaign spokesperson pointed us to a Gallup poll about black men under the age of 35. It found that about 24% of black men say the police have treated them unfairly in the past 30 days.
That doesn’t prove Sanders’ claim, so we set out to find crime rate numbers for black men under 35. But just like with juvenile data, there aren’t many federal statistics that count crime rates for black men in that age group, which makes it hard to confirm or deny Sanders’ statement.
We wanted to take a look at the three areas mentioned by Sanders during his interview with Cardi: jail inmates, probation and parole. We included prison inmates, too, since the Justice Department has age-specific data for them.
Prison inmates: Of 456,300 black men in state and federal prisons in 2017, about 44.4% were between the ages of 18 and 34.
Jail inmates: There were approximately 250,100 African Americans in local jails. There was no further breakdown by age or sex.
Probation and parole: Of the 3.67 million adults on probation at the end of 2016, about 28% were black. Of the 874,777 adults on parole, that proportion of black adults was higher at 38%. There was no further breakdown by age or sex.
Our ruling
Sanders said ""one out of four young black men in this country end up in the criminal justice system.""
We found that the senator’s specific claim is not directly supported by federal crime statistics, however you read it. That said, it might be a reasonable estimate based on incarceration trends and older research on crime rates among black men.
Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True."
12,"""Yesterday we had the strongest dollar in the history of our country.""","on Thursday, August 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-incorrect-us-dollar-strongest-its-eve/,False,Donald Trump,Donald Trump incorrect that U.S. dollar is strongest it's ever been,"Is the U.S. dollar stronger against other currencies than it’s ever been? President Donald Trump said so — at least four times in one day.
First, Trump tweeted on Aug. 21, 2019, that the United States has the ""Strongest Dollar in History.""
So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019 
A few hours later, Trump told reporters at the White House, ""Yesterday we had the strongest dollar in the history of our country."" He then repeated the assertion two more times. (The remarks start around 31:10 in this video.)
Trump wasn’t entirely cheerleading, as he acknowledged in his comments — he noted that having a strong dollar also has drawbacks. 
A strong dollar can benefit Americans traveling overseas, because their dollars will go further in the local currency. The downside, however, is that U.S. exports cost more overseas. This harms U.S. business output, and it can exacerbate the U.S. trade imbalance.
We wondered whether Trump was right that the U.S. dollar recently set a new historical high against foreign currencies.
It hasn’t. 

Currency traders work at a foreign exchange dealing room in Seoul, South Korea. (AP)
The most common way to track the overall strength of the dollar is the U.S. Dollar Index, a statistic that has been calculated for decades. It’s based on a weighted average of U.S. exchange rates with six currencies: primarily the Euro, but also the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc.
According to that index, the dollar was stronger as recently as many of the days between December 2016 to March 2017, and it was stronger still between late 1999 and early 2003. The dollar was at its peak historical strength during portions of the early to mid 1980s.
Trump didn’t specify any one foreign currency for his comparison, but a spot check of some of the big ones shows that Trump isn’t correct here, either. According to calculations by Markets Insider, the dollar is nowhere near the historical highs for one-on-one comparisons to the euro, yen or yuan.
On Aug. 20, the Euro could buy 1.11 dollars — but the Euro could often buy less than that between 2015 and 2017, and the record low of 0.64 dollars came in 1985. (That was compared with the European Currency Unit, or ECU, the predecessor to the Euro.)
Meanwhile, on Aug. 20, one dollar could buy 106 yen. But the dollar has been stronger for long stretches since 2014 and for much of the time between 1998 and 2008. And the dollar could buy a record 358.44 yen back in January 1971.
Finally, on Aug. 20, a dollar could buy 7.06 Chinese yuan. The dollar was stronger between at least 2000 and 2008.
""The president’s claim is fully unwarranted and clearly not factual,"" said Torben Andersen, director of the international business and markets program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. ""The U.S. dollar is strong, but nowhere as strong as in the mid 1980s.""
The strength of the dollar, Andersen added, ""is a natural outgrowth of better economic growth and higher interest rates in the U.S. than most other western developed economies.""
Our ruling
Trump said, ""Yesterday we had the strongest dollar in the history of our country.""
That’s not the case — the overall dollar index and one-to-one comparisons with the Euro, the yen and the yuan have all been stronger for the United States for long stretches of time in recent years. We rate the statement False.
Clarification, Aug. 23: This article has been updated to clarify that the strongest dollar exchange rate in history against the Euro was actually against the predecessor currency to the Euro, the ECU."
12,"The ""boyfriend loophole"" means that ""if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can.""","on Thursday, August 22nd, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/22/amy-klobuchar/boyfriend-loophole-some-convicted-domestic-violenc/,Half-True,Amy Klobuchar,ederal law’s ‘boyfriend loophole’ is not so simple,"After the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is running for president, called for eliminating the ""boyfriend loophole.""
The loophole, she said on MSNBC, ""means that right now if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can’t get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can, which is outrageous.""
Klobuchar has a point, but she oversimplifies the situation.
What the law says
Federal law bars anyone convicted of any felony from possessing a firearm. 
But the gun prohibition, as cited to us by Klobuchar’s campaign, also is imposed on people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. 
That provision applies to anyone who has or had a domestic relationship with the victim, said University of Wyoming law professor George Mocsary, co-author of a law school textbook on gun laws.
So, despite Klobuchar’s claim, the provision applies to more than just current or former spouses.
It applies if the perpetrator in the domestic abuse has a child in common with the victim; lives or lived with the victim; or is ""similarly situated to a spouse.""
As for the ""similarly situated"" language, some courts have said live-in boyfriends would be covered by the law, said Jacob Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University. And a regulation promulgated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives makes it clear that live-in partners are covered, Mocsary said.
Klobuchar’s claim of a loophole is accurate to the extent that the law does not apply to a boyfriend who is or was simply dating the victim, but not sharing a residence or children. 
But Mocsary said there is a difference in risk when there is a gun in a domestic situation versus someone who owns a gun but doesn’t live with their girlfriend.
""Everyone agrees that a firearm in a household with domestic violence poses a clear increased danger to the abused partner,"" he told PolitiFact. But there is no reliable evidence ""that there is a similar increased danger"" in non-cohabitation situations, he said.
Klobuchar’s claim was made in the context of federal law. But it’s worth noting that 23 states have laws that prohibit at least some abusive dating partners from gaining access to firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. 
That includes 19 states that bar people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from possessing a gun. Among them are California, Texas, Illinois and New York.
Our ruling
Klobuchar said the ""boyfriend loophole"" means that ""if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can.""
The gun prohibition, which is in federal law, does not apply to boyfriends who are, or were, in mere dating or more casual relationships. 
But it does apply to boyfriends who have a child in common with the domestic violence victim; live or lived with the victim; or who are ""similarly situated to a spouse.""
Also, 19 states have similar laws on misdemeanor domestic violence cases.
Klobuchar’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True."
12,"""On average, 65% of gun deaths in America are from suicides.""","on Wednesday, August 21st, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/aug/21/jason-miyares/62-us-gun-deaths-are-suicides/,Mostly True,Jason Miyares,62% of U.S. gun deaths are suicides | PolitiFact Virgin,"Del. Jason Miyares, R-Virginia Beach, has offered a compromise red-flag bill that would take firearms away from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others.
While the gun-control debate has largely focused on stopping mass shootings, Miyares says the biggest value of his bill could be that it would stop some people from shooting themselves.
""On average, 65% of all gun deaths in America are from suicides,"" he said during an August 14 interview on The John Frederick Show, a conservative radio broadcast. ""...This is one step we could do, in my opinion, to prevent people from harming themselves. ""It’s not just about some of the mass carnage.""
We fact-checked his claim that suicides account for 65 percent of gun deaths in the U.S. The latest information comes from an annual report issued in June 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study is called, ""Deaths, Final Data for 2017.""
According to the data, there were 38,882 deaths by firearms in 2017, and 23,854 were suicides. That comes to 61.4% - a little lower than Miyares’ figure.
In addition to suicides, the statistics showed 14,542 of the gun deaths (37.4%)  were murders, and 486 were accidental (1.2%).
Because Miyares began his statement saying ""on average,"" we computed 10 years of statistics - from 2008 through 2017. There were 335,746 gun deaths, and 208,287 were suicides. That’s a 62% average - again, a little lower than Miyares figure. 
Over 10 years, the CDC reported 335,746 gun deaths, and 208,287 were suicides. That’s 62%.
We asked Miyares for the source of his 65% claim, and he sent us a magazine article that ran in The Atlantic on Dec. 21, 2018. The article, referring to CDC data, said, ""suicides account for 60 percent of the country’s gun deaths.""
During the span from 2008 to 2017, slightly more than half of suicides were committed with firearms, according to CDC data. The number of yearly suicides increased by 36 percent - from 18,223 to 23,8545. Annual suicides by guns increased 30 percent, from 18,223 to 23,854.
Red-flag laws 
A number of Virginia legislators - most of them Democrats - have called for a red-flag law, predicting it would reduce gun violence. At least 15 states have enacted such measures.  
In Virginia, Democrats offered a bill this winter that would have allowed law-enforcement officials to ask a judge to declare a person a ""substantial risk"" to himself or others and order police to seize his guns for up 14 days. Sometime within that period, the person would have been entitled to a hearing to refute charges. If the judge found the charges credible, he could have ordered the guns held for renewable 180-day periods.
Republicans controlling a House subcommittee defeated the bill on a 4-2 vote. Gun enthusiasts complained the measure allowed guns to be taken without due process.
Miyares says his bill addresses that concern. It would require a person to be evaluated by a mental health expert and appear before a judge, with a chance to defend himself, before his firearms could be taken away for renewable 14-day periods. The General Assembly is expected to consider the measure in November.
Our ruling
Miyares, in promoting his red-flag bill, said, ""On average, 65% of gun deaths in America are from suicides.""
His figure slightly overstates a sad situation. CDC data shows that 62% of gun deaths from 2008 to 2017 were suicides. We rate his statement Mostly True."

The California senator then said as many as ""300,000 auto workers"" were expected to lose their jobs this year, suggesting Trump was to blame. 
""Donald Trump betrayed a lot of people. He came in office, making all kinds of promises to working people, from farmers to auto workers,"" Harris said in a CNN interview on Aug. 12. ""He said he was going to help working people, and it is estimated that as many as 300,000 auto workers may be out of a job before the end of the year."" 
Trump’s trade policy, especially the tariffs he’s placed on China, have been blamed by economists for hurting farmers. But are ""as many as 300,000 auto workers"" really expected to lose their jobs by the end of this year as Harris claimed? 
Two recent fact-checks called that figure into question. We’ll review the facts and place a rating on the senator’s claim.  
Checking the facts
After the interview, Harris’ campaign told CNN the 300,000 number is from a February study by the Center For Automotive Research, CAR. 
The research group examined the impact of a 25 percent tariff Trump proposed on all imported cars and auto parts except on Canada, Mexico and South Korea. It estimated that between about 70,000 jobs and 367,000 jobs would be lost across all sectors of the U.S. economy, but not specifically among autoworkers, under a ""worst-case scenario."" In May, Trump delayed for six months his decision on whether to impose the tariffs. 
Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor & economics at the research center, or CAR, told FactCheck.org in an email: ""300,000 auto workers out of a job before the end of the year is NOT what CAR is projecting."" FactCheck.org added that Dziczek confirmed the figure was an estimate for ""job loss across the economy"" one year after several proposed and implemented trade policies on the auto industry went into effect.

The CAR report did not specify how many of the up to 367,000 job losses would come from the auto industry. Dziczek told CNN ""the (auto) sector is starting to shrink,"" but she added that a rapid loss of 300,000 autoworker jobs ""would be orders of magnitude worse than what we're expecting to see.""
The only industry specific estimate was for 77,000 job losses at car dealerships. Dziczek told PolitiFact California there would ""an overall net loss"" in auto assembly and parts sectors. 
""How big of a loss depends on how willing consumers would be to switch brand preference from imports to vehicles made in the United States,"" she wrote in an email. 
FactCheck.org described Harris’ claim as ""wrong,"" while CNN said it was ""false."" 
Harris’ campaign did not respond to our request for comment, including whether the senator has corrected, or plans to correct, her statement. 
Our ruling 
Sen. Kamala Harris claimed that ""as many as 300,000 auto workers"" may lose their jobs by the end of this year. 
She relied on a study that predicted, in a worst-case scenario, that between 70,000 jobs and 367,000 jobs could be lost across all sectors of the U.S. economy, but in no way all from the auto industry. The losses would take place one year after President Trump imposes a proposed 25 percent tariff on imported cars and auto parts. 
Trump has delayed his decision on those tariffs until later this year, meaning the one-year later impact would not be felt until well into 2020, and not by the end of this year as Harris said.  
Harris’ claim far overestimates potential job losses for the auto industry, the timing of them and ignores the fact that no decision has been made on the tariffs. 
We rated her claim False.

12,"Says Hitler said, ""This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration!

""This year will go down in history,"" begins the Aug. 8 post. ""For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!""
The post attributes the statement to ""Adolph Hitler,"" misspelling the Nazi Party leader’s name before noting that he was remarking on the ""passing of the German Weapons Act 1935."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
When we reached out to several historians to find out if Hitler actually said this, they couldn’t tell us conclusively that he didn’t. But they were skeptical that the quote is authentic. 
Richard Breitman, an American University professor emeritus who has written extensively on German history and the Holocaust, said he was ""unaware of any such statement by Hitler."" He also noted that in addition to Hitler’s misspelled name in the Facebook post, the basic Nazi law on weapons was issued in 1938, not 1935, as the post says.
Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor who specializes in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, offered a quick history lesson:
A 1928 law that pre-dated the Nazi regime required people to seek state permission to buy or own a weapon and local police could revoke that permission at any time. 
In 1931, the law was amended to require people seeking that permission to prove they needed a weapon. 
In 1938, during Nazi rule, the law was changed so it was harder for Roma to have guns and easier for Nazis to carry them. 
A separate decree in 1938 forbade Jews from having guns. 
Maybe, Hayes said, the Facebook posts refers to another such a decree issued in 1935 but, ""I haven’t heard of it."" 
He was also suspicious of the language used in the Facebook quote. ""Registration"" isn’t a typical term in German gun laws, he said. 
Jeffrey Herf, a history professor at the University of Maryland, told us: ""My very strong suspicion is that this is a hoax.""
Christopher Browning, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor emeritus who has researched and written extensively about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, concurred. ""This sounds like a complete and total fabrication to me, invented for obvious reasons,"" he said. 
A 2004 Fordham Law Review article called ""On Gun Registration, the NRA, Adolf Hitler, and Nazi Gun Laws: Exploding the Gun Culture Wars (A Call to Historians)"" notes that the ""infamous statement"" attributed to Hitler has been published more than 100 times in papers across the country and lawmakers have argued against gun registration in part because it supposedly enabled Hitler to leave people vulnerable to the Nazis. (We’ve fact-checked whether gun control regulations in Nazi Germany helped advance the Holocaust and rated that False.)
But, author Bernard Harcourt says in the paper, the quote ""is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered."" 
""The citation reference is a jumbled and incomprehensible mess that has never been properly identified or authenticated, and no one has been able to produce a document corresponding to the quote,"" he wrote. ""It has been the subject of much research, all of it fruitless, and has now entered the annals of urban legends.""

12,"U.S. tariffs on China are ""not hurting anybody"" in the United States.","on Tuesday, August 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/20/peter-navarro/donald-trumps-tariffs-china-dont-hurt-americans-to/,Pants on Fire!,Peter Navarro,"Donald Trump's tariffs on China don't hurt Americans, top Trump adviser says. That's Pants on Fire","Are the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China hurting American consumers? His team says no. 
Peter Navarro, director of the White House’s Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that was not the case. Tapper asked about a study that found U.S. importers are shouldering about 95% of the price change from the tariffs, China only about 5%. 
After Navarro pushed back, there was this exchange:
""Tariffs aren't hurting anybody in the United States?"" asked Tapper.
Navarro responded, ""They're not hurting anybody here.""
The White House didn’t respond to our requests for information to support Navarro’s statement.
But evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.
Explaining the impact
Importers can respond to tariffs in four ways, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us. 
Two of the ways are paying their suppliers less and buying from producers in countries not subject to the tariffs; those moves would shield Americans.
But the other two ways — raising prices or absorbing the tariffs and cutting into their bottom line — do make an impact.
It’s worth noting that, in the back-and-forth of the trade war, China has done a series of its own tariff reductions. That helps U.S. exporters.
But despite claims by Trump that China has been slashing prices, Brookings economist Gary Burtless and Boise State University political scientist Ross Burkhart said they see no evidence of price slashing as a result of the U.S. tariffs — at least on any scale as large as the impact of the tariffs.
By the numbers
Evidence of how tariffs have hurt Americans has been accumulating for months.
Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs. 
The trade war reduced U.S. real income by $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University.
The price of washing machines sold in the United States rose nearly 12% because of the 2018 tariffs, according to University of Chicago researchers. (The price of dryers rose by a similar amount, even though they weren’t subject to the tariffs.)
Meanwhile, retaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers. U.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau, an agricultural lobbying group. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. Trump has responded by boosting subsidies to farmers.
Trump’s plan to impose more tariffs on China in September 2019 will reduce consumer purchases, raise prices and limit hiring, according to four national retail groups. 
Broad impact
Studies have also consistently documented the general impact on Americans. 
About 79% of manufacturers and 60% of service firms said tariffs had increased their input costs at least slightly, ""a considerably more widespread effect"" than in its survey a year earlier. That’s according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York August 2019 survey of business leaders in New York and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey. 
The impact of tariffs on imports of steel and Chinese goods that were imposed in 2018 was largely on the United States, not China, according to the study Tapper alluded to. It was done by researchers from Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
A variety of companies have reported harm from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs, including Walmart, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found.
Our ruling
Navarro said U.S. tariffs on China are ""not hurting anybody"" in the United States.
Numerous businesses, ranging from Coca-Cola, to Walmart to Costco to washing machine makers, raised prices because of the tariffs. And study after study has confirmed that the tariffs primarily hit Americans, not China. It’s simply ridiculous to make a flat claim that the tariffs aren’t hurting anyone in the United States.

12,"""The law says that mental health must be treated the same as physical health,"" but coverage by health insurers is unequal.","on Tuesday, August 20th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/aug/20/elizabeth-warren/warren-makes-point-disparities-insurance-coverage-/,True,Elizabeth Warren,Warren makes point on disparities in insurance coverage for physical and mental health | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"During a July visit to Milwaukee, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren told an audience that when it comes to their mental health needs, their health insurer may not always be on their side.
According to the Massachusetts senator, that’s because there is an unequal playing field when it comes to coverage of physical and mental health needs.
""The law says that mental health must be treated the same as physical health,"" Warren said at the League of United Latin American Citizens convention in Milwaukee on July 11, 2019, referencing the idea that health providers don’t care equally for the two. 
Warren was among eight Democratic presidential contenders, plus Jill Biden, wife of candidate Joe Biden, who attended the convention. LULAC is the largest and oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the country. 
But what does the law say about physical vs. mental health?
And, as Warren contends, do insurers treat them unequally?
Coverage requirements
When we reached out to Warren’s campaign for backup, spokesman Chris Hayden told us the senator was referring to the Affordable Care Act’s essential health benefits.
The ACA required small group and individual market plans to cover 10 different benefit categories, including maternity and newborn care, ambulance and emergency services and prescription drugs. Mental health and substance use disorder services were also included as benefits.
Hayden also pointed to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, sponsored by then-U.S. senators Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici, which was enacted in October 2008. The act requires equal coverage of treatment for mental illness and addiction.



 
According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the federal government released rules to implement the law in November 2013. Before the law, mental health treatment was typically covered at lower levels in health insurance policies than physical illness. 
So, Warren’s stance that the law requires equal insurance coverage of mental and physical health checks out.
But, is there a disparity in the way insurers service patients for those needs?
Studies show disparities in coverage
A 2017 national study by Milliman, a healthcare actuarial consulting firm, found patients used an out-of-network provider far more often for behavioral and mental health services than physical health needs. 
The study found that in 2015, behavioral care was four to six times more likely to be provided out-of-network than medical or surgical care, and insurers paid primary care providers 20% more for the same types of care than they paid addiction and mental health care specialists.
In Wisconsin, about 13% of office visits for behavioral health were out-of-network compared to 2.5% for primary care.
This underlines that the insurance network didn’t include as many doctors who provide mental health care.
Kaiser Health News reported on Aug. 3, 2015, that since the mental health parity law went into effect, most insurers had made progress in their mental health coverage, such as dropping annual limits on therapy sessions, making higher copayments and separate mental health deductibles less of an issue. 
However, Kaiser also reports insurers have continued to limit treatment through other methods, such as enforcing a ""medical necessity"" review for patients in some cases. In those reviews, insurers -- not doctors -- decide whether a patient requires a certain treatment and at what frequency.
Additionally, only a few states have checked up on whether insurers are complying with parity laws, and the U.S. government has not taken any public enforcement action against an insurer or employer for violating the law since it was passed, according to the Kaiser report.
Lawsuits against insurers alleging a lack of parity have been filed in states such as New York, Illinois and California where patients ran into issues regarding coverage for their mental health.
Enforcement challenges of health care laws
Ben Miller, chief strategy officer of Well Being Trust, an Oakland-based nonprofit focused on health issues, said one reason the parity law is hard to enforce is because most people don’t have a clear understanding of their health care coverage.
""We do not have clear transparency as ultimately what a health insurer might be doing,"" he said. ""Health insurance is like a black box.""
 Secondly, he said it’s time consuming to enforce it.
""States could easily step up and enforce the federal law,"" Miller said. ""I just don’t think that’s something that happens very often.""
Our ruling
Warren claimed mental health and physical health have to be treated the same under the law, but coverage by health insurers is unequal.
The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act says insurers must provide equal coverage of physical and mental health. The ACA made it a requirement for insurers to cover certain benefits which included behavioral health.
But various studies and reports found that insurers often fall short of upholding this law.

12,"""Wow, Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election!""","on Monday, August 19th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-google-manipulating-election-re/,False,Donald Trump,Donald Trump wrong on Google manipulating election results,"In his latest effort to recast his election win as an even bigger victory than the ballot box showed, President Donald Trump tweeted out an eye-popping — but unsubstantiated — claim. 
""Wow, Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election!"" Trump tweeted. ""This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought!"" 
Trump’s claim appears to trace back to a research paper published online in June 2017. He may have become aware of the paper after the right-wing website Town Hall ran an article that heavily cited it. The Washington Post reported that the same research paper was mentioned in a segment on Fox Business Network. 
The paper, by psychologist Robert Epstein, seeks to build off earlier research Epstein did on how bias in search engine results can affect voting preferences. (For the record, Epstein’s estimate was that between 2.6 million and 10.4 million votes may have been manipulated in 2016 — not up to 16 million votes, as Trump said.)
But a number of experts we reached out to said the latest paper’s methodology is freighted with too many flaws and unexplained assumptions to assert the kind of claim Trump makes here. 
A questionable approach
We reached out to Epstein to ask if he took issue with how Trump characterized his findings.
""I sure do,"" said Epstein, who supported Clinton in 2016. ""I have never said that Google deliberately manipulated the 2016 election.""
When we asked what formula and assumptions Epstein used to reach his bottom-line conclusion, we did not hear back. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Experts cited several major flaws in Epstein’s paper. 
First, here’s the study’s basic setup: In the run-up to the 2016 election, researchers recruited 95 people, 21 of whom identified as ""undecided.""
Over a 25-day period — from Oct. 15 through Election Day, Nov. 8 — researchers analyzed between 50 and 483 of these subjects' daily web searches.
Those search results were then farmed out to a crowdsourcing website, where raters voted on whether they found search results biased or not.
Their key finding: that ""election-related search terms were, on average, biased in Mrs. Clinton’s favor.""
Experts we spoke to cited a slew of problems with this methodology.
One common complaint was a lack of definitions. 
""They can't even define what biased search results are — they simply piped them off to a crowd-sourcing site and asked random people, ‘Is this search results page biased or not?’ "" said Ryan Singel, a media and strategy fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. ""What does that even mean?""
The researchers also discarded search results from users who operated Gmail accounts, after finding these users’ searches yielded less biased results. To the researchers, this raised concerns that ""perhaps Google identified our confidants through its gmail system and targeted them to receive unbiased results.""
But others doubted that explanation.
""They eliminated anyone using a Gmail address because their search results weren't considered ‘biased,’ speculating that Google was intentionally poisoning their research,"" Singel said. ""That's both equally laughable and sad.""
Setting aside the methodological flaws, others took exception to the researchers assumption about how well an experiment of this kind would translate to the voting booth. To some, the holes in the definitions and unexplained formulas used to extrapolate created more questions than answers.
We reached out to Nicholas Diakopoulos, a professor in communication studies and computer science at Northwestern University, to ask how researchers could get from 25 days’ worth of search results from 95 subjects to millions of manipulated votes.
""There's not enough information in the whitepaper about how the estimate was done,"" Diakopoulos said. 
He said the researchers likely developed a mathematical formula that seeks to translate examples of bias they collected into estimates of voter impact. 
""But again there is not enough information in the whitepaper to say definitively how their ‘computational model’ works,"" he said, ""and whether it is a valid estimate based on the assumptions built into the model."" 
Google refuted Trump’s statement, noting it was an old claim.
""This researcher's inaccurate claim has been debunked since it was made in 2016,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement. ""As we stated then, we have never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment.""
Our ruling
Trump said a new report shows ""Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election."" The general idea here is that Google gave people search results that in some way affected their vote in the lead-up to the election for president. 
Whether such indirect interactions could cause people to change their votes is questionable, and the paper — which is not new — does nothing to establish how that might happen. The paper doesn’t explain its methodology, and other academics questioned whether its findings were valid. Finally, Trump seems to have exaggerated the outer bound of the questionable findings.
Overall, we rate his statement False."

They get their standard issue gown sooner and with more attention. Even in Canada it's smart to keep donors happy. https://t.co/Rq1ic6Nzrz— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 15, 2019 
Really? Do wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals to get better treatment? Cuban’s tweet made it sound like standard operating procedure.
That sounded fishy to us, so we reached out and asked Cuban, who once flirted with running for president, what evidence he had to back up his claim. 
""Lol,"" he said. ""No. I’m not going to bust the people I spoke to.""
Cuban said the point of his Twitter thread was to inspire discussion about the pros and cons of the health care systems in the United States and Canada. (He has proposed eliminating insurance companies and using federal money to pay for more medical staffers, per CNBC.)
He told us to ask major hospitals in Canada if they give donors phone numbers to call to arrange for better treatment. So we did. We also talked to a number of experts. 
The bottom line: Cuban might know a few rich Canadians who have their doctors on speed dial because they gave money to build a building, buy new equipment or fund research. But as a general rule of thumb, Canadian hospitals don’t award special privileges to wealthy donors.
The Canadian health-care system
Generally speaking, health care in Canada is delivered by private doctors and hospitals but paid for with public funds. That’s why Democratic politicians such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have praised Canada as a model for what single-payer health care could look like in the United States.  
Provinces and territories are in the driver’s seat, but the federal government helps handle the costs and decides which services the provinces must cover to receive federal money.
Canadians don’t pay out-of-pocket for medically necessary care, defined as visits to the doctor or the hospital. (A majority of Canadians buy supplemental private insurance to cover the costs of prescription drugs, dental care and other services, however.)
We won’t discount the possibility that Cuban knows people who feel their donations gave them an upper hand with their specific hospital or doctor. But hospital representatives and health policy experts told us that, while there might be isolated cases of donors getting preferential treatment, those scenarios are highly unlikely and might be against federal law.
Do donors get better treatment?
We called the press offices for a number of Canada’s largest hospitals from several different provinces. Many of them didn’t answer. But those that did were skeptical of Cuban’s claim.
""I can emphatically and strongly say no, that doesn’t happen at St. Paul’s,"" said Shaf Hussain, spokesperson for Providence Health Care, which operates hospitals across British Columbia, including St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver. (St. Paul’s received a record $75 million donation from a billionaire in 2017.)
""We do have a very generous donor community, and we are always grateful for any support provided for equipment or research,"" Hussain said. ""But no, that does not result in any kind of special treatment or access to health care.""
Hussain and Ted Marmor, professor of public policy and management at Yale University, said prioritizing donors would violate the federal Canada Health Act, which stresses the importance of ""facilitat(ing) reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.""
""As a general description of Canadian hospital practice, (Cuban’s claim) is mythology,"" Marmor said. ""That some patients have participated in pursuit of quicker service with donations is no doubt true. But this is an exaggerated portrait of hospital admission.""
Other Canadian experts agreed. 
""Donors give to hospitals as signs of appreciation, civic-minded investment in infrastructure or equipment, or to invest in specific kinds of hospital-based research,"" said Antonia Maioni, professor of political science at McGill University in Montreal. ""There is no quid pro quo.""
""There is not a direct relationship between whether you contribute and what care you get,"" added Raisa Deber, professor of public health policy at the University of Toronto.
For what it’s worth, donations are ""not a significant source of financing Canadian hospitals,"" Marmor said. According to the World Health Organization, 70% of total health expenditures in Canada come from general tax revenues collected by various levels of government.
Our ruling
Cuban said ""wealthy people in Canada donate to hospitals"" to get better treatment.
It’s possible Cuban knows some people who claim they’ve gotten special treatment, but hospital representatives and health policy experts told us Cuban’s claim is an inaccurate description of what happens in Canadian hospitals by and large. It’s also at odds with Canadian law, which says people should have access to care regardless of finances.

The post displays a photo of a snake wrapped around a handgun with the words ""Don’t Tread On Me."" Along the bottom, the alleged statement by Jefferson reads:
""When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""
But did he say it? The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Like many statements attributed to Jefferson on the internet, there is no credible evidence to support that Jefferson said or wrote these words. 
According to Monticello.org, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation's website, the statement cannot be found in any of the former president’s writings. Both parts of the quote appear in the website’s list of ""Spurious Quotations."" 
Researchers at Monticello found that the first sentence: ""When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny,"" most likely comes from a series of debates on socialism published in 1914. At one point, a man named John Basil Barnhill said, ""Where the people fear the government you have tyranny. Where the government fears the people you have liberty.""
Some variations of the quote begin with, ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms,"" as the first sentence, which comes from the first of Jefferson's three drafts of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, although in the second and third drafts, the sentence was amended to read, ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms (within his own lands or tenements).""
Again, the latter sentence about using guns for protection against tyranny in government, Monticello officials say, ""does not appear in the Virginia Constitution drafts or text as adopted, nor in any other known Jefferson writings.""

12,"Says after the shooting in El Paso, ""on Sunday, everyone was going to church in America, praying about this, and the next day when their kids went to school, they weren’t allowed to pray or bring it up.""","on Monday, August 19th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/aug/19/dan-patrick/could-students-pray-discuss-el-paso-mass-shooting/,False,Dan Patrick,"Could students pray, discuss El Paso mass shooting in school? | PolitiFact Texas","In an interview on Fox News almost a week after the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso in August that left 22 people dead and more than two dozen injured, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick discussed the attack and possible motivating factors. 
He mentioned mental health and violent video games during the interview. He also raised concerns about spiritual values.
Patrick said that ""on Sunday, everyone was going to church in America, praying about this, and the next day when their kids went to school, they weren’t allowed to pray or bring it up."" 
He made a similar comment during an appearance on Fox News the day after the shooting: ""I look at this Sunday morning when most of your viewers right now, half of the country, are getting ready to go to church and yet tomorrow, we won’t let our kids even pray in our schools.""
Patrick’s claim is off base. Kids are allowed to pray in schools and they are permitted to discuss current events — including mass shootings. 
Patrick offered a statement when asked about his claim: 
""I have pointed to a broad range of factors that contribute to domestic terrorism including a fraying in our culture that elevates hate and devalues life,"" Patrick said. ""In terms of prayer in our public schools, we do have a minute of silence for students to do what they wish, but there was a time when students prayed together out loud and students and schools weren’t sued or banned from praying at pep rallies and graduations. There was a time when city mayors didn’t sue pastors for their sermons and when reporters like you would never have challenged the idea that the issue of faith in America is important. We were a better country when everyone recognized that we all answer to a higher authority — and it wasn’t government. Many of us in America still believe that.""
Do most Americans go to church? 
First of all, in both interviews Patrick suggested that either ""everyone"" or ""half of the country"" went to church on Sunday to pray following the shooting in El Paso.
There’s no way to know for sure how many people across the country attended a religious service on a particular day, but there has been polling on American’s habits when it comes to religion that can offer some insight here.
In 2017, about 39% of Americans attended religious services at least once a week, according to Pew Research Center. Roughly 33% attended a few times per month or per year. Some of those people attended services in mosques, temples and gathering places others than churches.
A poll from Gallup also looked at this trend: in 2018, 22% of Americans attended church or synagogue every week and 10% attended almost every week.
Students are allowed to pray
Patrick said that Texas children were not allowed to pray when they went to class the day after the shooting in El Paso. 
Patrick was likely not speaking about a specific example of a school preventing a child from praying. For one, most schools in Texas were still on summer vacation when he made his claim. 
In a landmark decision in 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school-sponsored or state-organized prayer, even nondenominational prayer, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 
But the decision does not prohibit prayer or religious expression at school.
""Contrary to popular myth, the Supreme Court has never outlawed ‘prayer in schools’"", reads a blog post from the Freedom Forum Institute. ""Students are free to pray alone or in groups, as long as such prayers are not disruptive and do not infringe upon the rights of others.""
At the same time, students do not have a ""right to have a captive audience listen"" and they cannot pressure other students to join them in prayer, the institute said.
In Texas, state law dictates that school boards must require all schools in the district to offer a one-minute moment of silence at every campus. During this period, students are allowed to ""reflect, pray, meditate, or engage in any other silent activity.""
These same restrictions on prayer and religious expression do not apply to private schools.
Discussion of shooting
Patrick also said that students would not be able to discuss the shooting in El Paso during school. The basis of his claim is unclear.
There is no state-level policy that dictates whether teachers can facilitate discussions of current  events in the classroom. Plus, students are permitted to discuss these issues among themselves or in one-on-one conversations with teachers or school counselors.
School counselors serve myriad roles, including as a sounding board for students who want to vent about their home life and as a resource for students with more serious mental health concerns. 
They also can serve a preventative role, helping to identify students in crisis, while also being a resource for students struggling in the wake of a mass shooting who want to talk about the event.
Earlier this year, state lawmakers approved a series of laws aimed at increasing school safety after a shooting at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area left eight students and two teachers dead.
Included in the slew of new laws was a proposal aimed at improving mental health services available to students by expanding access to mental health professionals and offering mental health training to teachers and other school professionals.
Our ruling
In two interviews, Patrick said that students would not be able to pray following the mass shooting in El Paso. He also said they would be unable to discuss the shooting at school.
Patrick’s claim is inaccurate. School-sponsored prayer is prohibited, but students are allowed to pray individually and, in Texas, during a required moment of silence.
There is no statewide policy that dictates whether teachers can discuss current events with their students, including mass shootings. There are many avenues available to students who wish to discuss these events with school personnel.

The shooting ended after an hours-long standoff with the suspect, who was being served a narcotics warrant. Some Facebook users speculated that the incident was staged. One user with nearly 30,000 followers posted a news clip of the event with a caption that suggested two officers faked gunshot wounds.
""WTF!! Philadelphia Shootings Fake AF!!"" the user wrote. ""Police Officers Spray Fake Blood on themselves during Philadelphia Shooting."" Similar claims were also shared on Reddit.

The suspicious Facebook posts claim this is fake blood. A comment on the second post suggests that it might instead be a kind of disinfectant containing iodine, which is a dark reddish color.
We reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department for more context. It said the assertion that its officers were faking their injuries is false.
""This is outrageous,"" the department’s public affairs office said in an email. ""Police officers were transported to Temple University Hospital and Albert Einstein Medical Center for gunshot wounds. This video is one of our police officers that suffered a gunshot wound Wednesday.""
When asked about the substance that appears in the video, the police department said it’s real blood.

12,"In Australia ""they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela.""","on Monday, August 19th, 2019",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/aug/19/matt-gaetz/fact-checking-matt-gaetz-gun-bans-australia-and-ve/,Mostly False,Matt Gaetz,-checking Matt Gaetz on gun bans in Australia and Venezuela | PolitiFact Florid,"U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparred with Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro about how to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.
""I’m here in Australia, congressman. They don’t have problems like this,"" Pirro said Aug. 10 following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. ""This is starting to be unfortunately a uniquely American situation. And I am a gun owner. I am a strong Second Amendment person, but some of the wrong people are getting their hands on guns.""
Gaetz replied: ""Nobody would suggest that in the United States we would want Australia’s solution. There they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela. And now their people can't fight back when they are having to fight their way out of a socialist dictator.""
But no one suggested taking away guns, Pirro responded, adding the Gaetz’s Venezuela comparison seemed ""a little off."" 
So PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into it. The general point Gaetz was trying to make, his spokesman told us, was that he believes gun control failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He shared articles showing an Australian black market for guns, for example, as well as other news stories about Venezuela’s gun control laws leaving civilians and even police more vulnerable. 
But there are several factual inaccuracies with his specific claim about Australia and the comparison to Venezuela.
• Australia didn’t enact a total gun ban; it banned certain guns, including semi-automatics after a mass shooting in 1996. 
• That’s different from what Venezuela’s government did in 2012 and 2013, when it took steps in an effort to stem the flow of guns.
• In both countries, millions of guns remain in civilian hands. Gun deaths are a major problem in Venezuela.
Gun control in Australia
In 1996, a shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. It was one of the most deadly civilian mass shootings in the world at the time. The conservative-led national government moved quickly to ban and destroy certain guns.
Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms. After that, people possessing the weapons would be subject to strict penalties. The buyback program took in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons — roughly one-fifth of the country’s estimated guns.
Today, Australians still legally own a high per-capita ratio of single-shot long guns, along with plenty of handguns, said Philip Alpers, founding director of Gunpolicy.org, a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. But the number of legal and illegal guns dropped from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997. 
Since then, it has climbed back up to almost the same number as before the ban, though the rate of gun ownership is smaller today.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings, which claimed 117 lives, Alpers said. Following the gun law changes, there were no mass shootings for many years. In June 2019, four people were killed by a gunman who used a banned gun. In 2018, seven were killed in a mass family homicide-suicide.
Gun control in Venezuela
What Venezuela did several years ago was not the same as Australia.
The gun situation was not the same, for starters. In Australia, the government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela faced a widespread problem with rampant gun violence and homicides — and it still does.
In 2012, Venezuela imposed measures to ban possession of a gun in public places and to halt private gun sales to citizens. 
In 2013, President Nicolas Maduro signed a disarmament bill that was intended to stem the flow of guns.
The law created an automated system of registration for arms, parts, and ammunition under control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed conditional possession, meaning that the state could take their gun. 
Rebecca Hanson, an expert on crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said she wouldn’t call the 2013 law a ""gun ban,"" because civilians could still own guns as long as they registered them. Also, guns remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lax.
""The law, in reality, did not affect people's ability to access guns in any effective or long-term way,"" she said.
Since the majority of guns are purchased on the black market, regulating the legal market does little to reduce gun sales in Venezuela, she said. Many of these guns end up flowing from state security forces and the military into the black market. 
""All of this is to say that even with the 2013 law, access to guns has increased,"" she said.
Alejandro Velasco, New York University history professor of modern Latin America, told us that ""the gun ban had almost no practical impact on people’s ability to buy and keep (or use) weapons.""
There are no solid numbers to pinpoint the number of guns in civilian ownership in Venezuela. Gunpolicy.org estimates that there were about 5.9 million privately owned guns in civilian hands in Venezuela  as of 2017, though the consultant that came up with it said it could be a wide range. 
The opposition movement has billed itself as nonviolent for the most part, Velasco said. Several experts told us it’s not surprising that civilians don’t bring guns to protests where they face the armed government. 
""Even if the disarmament law had dramatically reduced gun ownership, which is not at all clear, armed anti-government civilians would stand no chance against the tanks and fighter jets of the army,"" said Dorothy Kronick, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist.
Experts were critical of Gaetz using the problems in Venezuela to make any commentary on gun laws in the United States.
""Linking the issue of arms control with the struggle for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to distort a situation that is already very distorted,"" Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela said, ""increasing violence in an environment that is already very violent, and undermines an institution that is already very precarious.""
Our ruling
Gaetz said in Australia ""they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela.""
Gaetz’s claim about Australia is wrong, and his comparison to Venezuela is flawed.
After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns and offered a one-year buyback. It did not ban all guns. The number of civilian-owned guns is now nearly the same as before the 1996 law, although the rate of ownership is less.
In Venezuela, the government instituted measures to try to limit the flow of guns to civilians. But experts said most guns are sold on the black market and that guns remain rampant in Venezuela. The idea that private gun owners could successfully challenge a national military is also unlikely.

12,"Says Pennsylvania chemical plant and Louisiana liquified natural gas plant ""could never have happened"" without his administration.","on Friday, August 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/16/donald-trump/trump-falsely-takes-credit-two-large-industrial-pr/,False,Donald Trump,Trump falsely takes credit for two large industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvan,"President Donald Trump has been taking credit for very large industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania. At a rally in Manchester, N.H., Trump said his policies were critical.
""In Pennsylvania we just opened up a $10 billion plant,"" Trump said Aug. 15. ""We have many of them going up. Many, a lot of jobs. In Louisiana an LNG (liquified natural gas) plant — $10 billion — could never have happened, could never have happened. Pennsylvania would have never happened.""
Earlier in the week, Trump was outside Pittsburgh to see a nearly completed Shell plastics plant. The massive facility will turn natural gas from fracking into polyethylene pellets. Announced in 2012 and started in 2015, the plant has produced about 6,000 construction jobs, with 600 permanent jobs expected.
""It was the Trump administration that made it possible,"" Trump told a sea of workers in yellow and orange worksite vests Aug. 13. ""No one else. Without us, you would never have been able to do this.""
Trump has crowed before about his role in getting the Louisiana plant up and running.
""It was many, many years trying to get permits, they couldn't get the permits,"" he said at a July 16 cabinet meeting. ""But we got the permits, and we got them very rapidly.""
The reality is that the LNG plant in Louisiana and the plant in Pennsylvania were in the works during the Obama years.
The Louisiana plant
The Cameron LNG project has three plants that chill down natural gas until it becomes a liquid to be shipped worldwide. At capacity, it can handle 1.7 billion cubic feet per day.
According to the company website, ""In April 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued the final environmental impact statement to construct and operate the liquefaction facility. FERC authorized the project in June 2014.""
The company got its first federal approval in 2012. In 2016, Washington gave permission to add another two liquefaction lines, although the company hasn’t decided to move ahead on those.
While LNG exports have skyrocketed under Trump, which makes this plant more profitable, the actual plans and permits came well before he took office.
The Pennsylvania plant
In 2012, Royal Dutch Shell picked an old industrial site in western Pennsylvania for a major petrochemical facility. Shell’s American division Shell Chemical Appalachia bought the property in 2014 and began pre-construction work in early 2015.
Shell made the final decision to build the plant in June 2016.
The project needed two key permits for air and water quality protection, but those were state-level decisions. By mid 2015, Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection had granted initial permits for both. Final approvals were in place by mid 2018.
Washington did play a role in a pipeline to deliver natural gas to the plant. While the state approved construction in 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had to sign off on the rates the company would charge pipeline users. It issued its approval in September 2018. However, in its order, the commission noted that the company’s proposal was ""unopposed.""
Trade war impacts
While both projects are humming along, they have not been totally untouched by Trump’s use of tariffs.
Export demand for LNG remains high, but Trump’s trade war with China has reduced shipments to that country. In 2017, China was the third-biggest buyer. In 2018, China responded to U.S. tariffs with a 10% tariff on LNG. Reuters reported in May 2019 that only two ships headed to China had left from the United States since January, compared to 14 in the first four months of 2018.
Trump’s steel tariffs threatened progress on the Pennsylvania petrochemical complex. In the face of quotas limiting steel imports, Shell warned in 2018 that it would need to slow construction and might lay off hundreds of workers.
U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sent a letter to the administration Aug. 23, 2018, asking for relief. The administration did so within a week.
Our ruling
Trump said that two major industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania exist today thanks to his policies. In reality, both were well underway before he took office.
The Louisiana plant had all necessary federal permits by 2014.
The Pennsylvania chemical complex was subject to state regulations, and initial approvals came in 2015. Federal regulators approved the rate structure for a key pipeline in 2018, but construction approval for the pipeline itself came from the state, not the federal government.
Trump can take credit for boosting LNG exports and pushing a regulatory approach in favor of natural gas, but those dynamics were in play before his election.

We all know the arduous practice of cutting onions makes us cry like babies – but is consuming day-old chopped onions actually ""poisonous""?
That’s what a Facebook post claims:
""Please remember it is dangerous to cut an onion and try to use it to cook the next day, it becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This years-old warning is exaggerated. Don’t be scared to use pre-chopped onions – they are perfectly safe to consume as long as you handle the food properly.
The myth is rooted in the possibility that bacteria can grow on vegetables between the time they are chopped and cooked. But with proper handling and storage, it is unlikely to become ""dangerous"" overnight or over several nights. 
In an archived blog post, Joe Schwarcz, director of the McGill Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Canada, writes that onions are not especially prone to bacterial contamination. In fact, he says, it is quite the opposite.
""Cutting an onion triggers the release of enzymes that initiate a chemical reaction producing propenesulfenic acid, which in turn decomposes to yield sulphuric acid. It is the sulphuric acid that makes you cry by irritating the eyes! But sulphuric acid also inhibits the growth of bacteria,"" Schwarcz says in the post. 
He goes on to explain that because a cut onion’s surface dries out quickly, it reduces the moisture needed for bacteria to multiply. And to have bacteria multiply, there needs to be a source of bacteria on the onion in the first place.
So unless you have sliced your onions on a contaminated cutting board, or handled them with dirty hands, you can safely put them in a plastic bag and store them and there will not be any bacterial contamination,"" he says. ""There is no reason to suggest that onions are in any way more risky than other foods and avoiding onions is not only unnecessary but unhealthy. That’s because onions contain a variety of compounds that have health benefits.
According to the National Onion Association, chopped or sliced onions can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for seven to 10 days. 
Our ruling
An old myth circulating online warns consumers that pre-chopping an onion to cook the following day is dangerous because it ""becomes highly poisonous"" and ""creates toxic bacteria.""
Any vegetable can become contaminated with bacteria if it isn’t handled or stored properly. Onions do not attract bacteria more than other vegetables and actually inhibit pathogen growth.

But after his Aug. 7 visit to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, internet users started to share a false rumor that a viral photo of Trump smiling with a group of nurses was staged, and that the nurses were actually paid actors.
Several Facebook posts say that media members were not permitted access during the visit and that the women arrived at the hospital a few hours before Trump. While it is true that reporters were not permitted to enter the hospital while Trump was visiting, the rest of the claim is false.
One of the posts shares a Twitter screenshot from someone named Farid Ghalili that reads: 
""I got a text from a friend who knows a nurse at the hospital told her that many of the women who were at the hospital wearing nurse uniforms did not work at the hospital. They showed up a couple of hrs before Trump arrived. This was staged. That’s why no reporters were allowed.""
Another post includes the now-viral image of the nurses smiling and embracing Trump claimed:
""No media allowed. The nurses report that the women in this picture don’t work at their hospital. ‘Why is he surrounded by mostly women all touching him. No media access...this is so propaganda bullshit from an installed Russian operative.’ Various News agencies are researching this photo and the people that were posed or paid to be in it. The one woman on the far right in scrubs was at his rallies. There may be others that were viewed at his rallies as well. Notice all the badges are turned backwards.""
Some commenters expressed skepticism of the photo’s authenticity by questioning why those photographed appeared in different colored scrubs.
The posts, both from Aug. 8, were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We reached out to the user at the Farid Ghalili Twitter account, @faridghalili, about his claim that he received a text from a friend about the photo being staged. Ghalili responded to PolitiFact in a direct message, saying that the text he mentioned came from an ex-hospital employee he knows who lives in Ohio. He said the person told Ghalili that neither his friend nor his friend’s source wanted to talk to reporters. ""I belive (sic) a good investigative reporter can check and coraborate (sic) this,"" Ghalili told us. ""But so far from what I have heard the hospital staff and nurses are not talking about it.""
Well, we did our own reporting. The photo is real and the women in it are employees at the hospital. 
Sharon D. Howard, communications director at Miami Valley Hospital, confirmed to PolitiFact that the women in the photo are employed at the hospital.
""They are employees at the hospital. The pictures from the visit include our nurses, our staff, first responders and our patients,"" Howard said. ""(And) the color of the scrubs can differ depending on what unit you work in.""

13,"""We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. ... And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases because they know that they’re not on very solid ground.""","on Friday, August 16th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/16/donald-trump/did-donald-trump-turn-around-us-record-wto/,Mostly False,Donald Trump,Did Donald Trump turn around U.S. record at the WTO?,"During a visit to a new Shell plant outside Pittsburgh, President Donald Trump attacked the World Trade Organization, the international entity that decides trade disputes.
""We were losing all our cases until I came along,"" Trump said in Monaca, Pa. ""We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. Almost every case, ... lost, lost, lost. They thought we were stupid. They were the ones ruling. And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases because they know that they’re not on very solid ground.""
Is that accurate?
We found that certain aspects of the U.S. record at the WTO are slightly better. But overall, we found no dramatic turnaround.
About the WTO
More than 160 nations have joined the World Trade Organization, an institution that serves as a forum for resolving international trade disputes. 
Before proceeding to litigation, countries can work out their differences through a ""conciliation and mediation"" process. Trade experts told PolitiFact that roughly 60% of claims are settled this way, without the WTO rendering a ""winner"" or ""loser"" at all.
In the roughly 40% of cases that remain unresolved, the dispute goes to a WTO-approved panel of three, none of whom are from a country involved in the dispute.
So, for starters, Trump ignored that most WTO cases don’t produce a winner or loser. Kent Jones, an economist at Babson College, called the conciliation system a benefit of the WTO because it encourages the disputing parties to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution of the case.
Another point that Trump glossed over is that ""countries typically do not bring WTO dispute cases unless they are confident that they will win,"" Jones said.
This produces a longstanding and distinct pattern of wins and losses: The complaining country usually wins. And that cuts both ways for supporting Trump’s assertion.
Dan Ikenson of the pro-free-trade Cato Institute looked at the U.S. record in WTO trade disputes between 1995 and 2017. He found that when the United States was defending against a complaint, it lost 89% of the time.
That would seem to support at least part of Trump’s assertion — but it leaves out the other side of the coin. 
In cases where the United States was the complaining party, Ikerson found a 91% U.S. victory rate. (Also worth noting: The United States was the most active complaining party.)
The U.S. record — strong as a complainant, weak as a defendant — is mirrored by the records of most other countries, trade specialists said.
Trade experts said they were unaware of comprehensive studies that went past March 2017. But Elena V. McLean, a political scientist at the University at Buffalo-State University of New York, did a ""very quick estimate"" of recent cases for PolitiFact and found a slightly improved record for the United States.
From 2017 to 2019, she said, the United States brought two cases as a complainant and won both, which is in line with past results. In seven cases brought against the United States, the United States won three, or 43%. That’s a bit better than the U.S. long-term performance, though it’s still a losing record.
We did not hear back from the White House and the U.S. Trade Representative when we asked for any additional supporting data for Trump’s assertion.
Trump’s impact on the WTO
It’s unlikely that Trump’s positions changed the WTO’s ruling patterns, trade experts agreed.
WTO cases often take years to reach a final decision, so some of the decisions McLean tallied were inherited from the period before Trump came to office, she said.
The United States did win one notable, if ""arcane,"" case during Trump’s tenure that broke with a pattern of previous losses on the same issue, said Stuart S. Malawer, a professor of law and international trade at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. The case involves Canada and concerned the methodology of determining the price of imports in dumping cases, he said. 
However, Malawer said that there was no indication that a change of policy by Trump had anything to do it. The decision ""seems to be based principally on the technical aspects of the issue,"" he said.
Experts said it was ironic that Trump was trumpeting his victories at the WTO when his administration has blocked new judges for appointment to the WTO’s appellate body.
""In a matter of months, this U.S. action will deplete the roster of judges and deprive the WTO of a working dispute settlement system,"" Jones said.
If that happens, McLean said, ""the politics of trade will become much less cooperative, and escalation to all-out trade wars will become much more likely. And the overall effect of trade wars on economies, global and domestic, is not something that can be described as ‘winning,’ no matter how you slice it.""
Our ruling
Trump said, ""We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. ... And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases because they know that they’re not on very solid ground.""
This statement contains multiple problems. For decades, the United States, like essentially all countries, has tended to lose most WTO cases in which it was a defendant. But it has won most cases when it was the complaining party.
Under Trump, there are some indications of an improved (though still losing) U.S. record in cases it’s defending against. But trade experts say this has had little to do with Trump’s policies, which have in fact put the WTO’s continued operations at risk.
We rate the statement Mostly False."

13,"""97% of murders occur with handguns.""","on Thursday, August 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/illinois/statements/2019/aug/15/adam-kinzinger/are-handguns-used-commit-nearly-all-murders/,Mostly False,Adam Kinzinger,Are handguns used to commit nearly all murders? | PolitiFact Illinois,"In the wake of mass shootings in California, Texas and Ohio, and continued summer violence in Chicago, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger has come out in favor of some gun restriction measures.
Kinzinger represents Illinois’ 16th district, a 14-county area that wraps around Chicagoland from Wisconsin to Indiana. In February, he voted against a bipartisan House bill to expand background checks for gun purchases. Now, he is now advocating for universal background checks, along with laws to make it easier for authorities to take guns from unstable individuals, raise the legal age of purchase for all firearms to 21 and ban some large-capacity magazines.
But he won’t yet go so far as to support a ban on assault-style weapons like the semi-automatic rifles used in recent mass shootings, a point he was asked to address in an interview with Fox 32’s Mike Flannery.
""Your Republican colleague, Rep. (Mike) Turner from the Dayton area, he’s now saying he's ready to vote for banning the assault rifles,"" said Flannery, referencing Dayton, Ohio, where a recent shooting left nine people dead. ""Is that an idea you’d consider?""
""Not right now,"" Kinzinger responded. ""I mean, look, I think it’s like 97% of murders occur with handguns. That’s really where the big problem is.""
Most murders are committed with firearms, a majority of them handguns, federal data show. Even so, Kinzinger significantly stretched the facts by claiming handguns are used to commit nearly all murders.
A significant share, but nowhere near 97%
To assess Kinzinger’s claim, we turned to data catalogued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
In 2017, the latest year for which figures on murder weapons were available, handguns were used in 46% of all homicides — far from the 97% Kinzinger cited.
We asked Kinzinger’s office to explain the discrepancy, but did not receive a response.
If Kinzinger was referring to the share of firearm homicides that involve a handgun instead of murders overall, he would have gotten a little closer to the mark. However, those figures still fail to back up his claim.
Firearms were used to commit 73% of all murders in 2017, FBI data show. And in at least 64% of those cases, the firearm was a handgun.
In another 28% of murders committed with firearms, local police agencies did not specify the type used when reporting those cases to the FBI. But experts told us it’s reasonable to expect instances in which the firearm was not identified would likely follow the same pattern as those that were categorized.
After adding nearly two-thirds of the unidentified cases reported in 2017 to the handgun category, the share of firearm murders committed with a handgun rises to 82%. That’s substantially higher, but still well below what Kinzinger claimed.
In addition, we reviewed 10 years’ worth of FBI data and found the pattern held steady over time, something experts we spoke with also noted.
""That (97%) is too high a number,"" said David Hemenway, who directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. ""But to say that most people in the United States who are murdered are killed with guns and the large majority of people who are killed with guns are killed with handguns, that’s true every year.""
Addressing mass shootings vs overall homicides
As for Kinzinger’s assertion that handgun murders are ""the big problem,"" it is clear that handguns are far more commonly used in murders than assault-style rifles, or rifles in general. The FBI does not define assault weapons.
But that doesn’t mean shootings committed with high-capacity semi-automatic firearms that allow a shooter to quickly kill many people in a short amount of time don’t pose serious problems for lawmakers to address. Indeed, much of Kinzinger’s recent proposal centers on the issue in response to the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio that left 31 people dead.
""If you said, I want to do one thing that reduces overall homicide in the United States, it would not be to ban assault weapons,"" Hemenway said.
But addressing mass shootings requires lawmakers to consider policies not directly aimed at reducing total homicides, Hemenway added, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Our ruling
Kinzinger claimed 97% of murders are committed with handguns.
That figure is off-target. In 2017, 46% of all murders were committed with handguns, federal data show. Firearms were used in more than 70% of all homicides, however. And in at least two-thirds of those cases, the firearm was a handgun, making them by far the most common murder weapon.
We rate Kinzinger’s claim Mostly False.

MOSTLY FALSE — The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

13,"Says the Trump administration’s new policy for legal immigrants on welfare ""has been around for a while. This is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement here, that the United States has been this way.""","on Thursday, August 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/aug/15/rob-schmitt/whats-new-trumps-public-charge-immigration-policy/,Half-True,Rob Schmitt,What’s new in Trump’s policy for legal immigrants on welfare | Pund,"The Trump administration recently announced a new rule broadening the government’s ability to deny visas and permanent residency to legal immigrants who get public benefits.
The rule, set to take effect on Oct. 15, is a new interpretation of an older immigration law and the latest effort by President Donald Trump to restrict certain types of immigration to the United States. But there’s some confusion over what this new rule will do and how drastic it is.
On the Aug. 14 episode of ""Fox & Friends First,"" anchor Rob Schmitt moderated a discussion over the new policy, which he introduced as ""changes to immigration laws that could deny green cards to migrants who need welfare in this country.""
""This rule has been around for a while,"" he said at one point. ""This is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement here, that the United States has been this way.""
That made our ears perk up, so we decided to dig into the history of laws that zero in on those considered likely to become ""public charges,"" or burdens to American taxpayers. 
Our finding: Schmitt’s statement is partially accurate. While a public charge law has been on the books for more than 100 years, the Trump administration’s broad interpretation of it is unprecedented. 
Fox News declined to comment.
Old law, new interpretation
Public charge laws are regulations that say immigrants to the United States can be turned away if they are likely to depend on public assistance programs. 
Schmitt is right that the public charge law is nothing new. But his claim that ""this is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement"" leaves out some important details.
""There is a long history of public charge law in this country, but the new regulation represents a big expansion in how this law is interpreted and applied,"" said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank in Washington. ""We have never before had such a broad interpretation in place of who might become a public charge.""
A public charge law first appeared as part of the Immigration Act of 1882. Back then, immigrants generally had to show they had cash to spare and enough money to buy a ticket to their ultimate United States destination, Gelatt said.
The public charge rule was reaffirmed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and has held its place in the immigration system ever since. But for a long time, the law offered no clear definition for determining whether a person was a potential public charge.
Eventually, a 1996 bill said the Immigration and Naturalization Service should consider a person’s age, health, family status, financial resources, education, skills and ability to secure a sponsor’s written support when deciding if he or she would likely become a public charge.
In 1999, the INS clarified that the term ""public charge"" applied specifically to immigrants who were ""primarily dependent"" on government cash assistance or long-term, institutionalized care.
The Trump administration’s new rule expands that definition, experts told us, and it will affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants who come legally to the United States each year and apply to stay permanently. 
Once the rule goes into effect, immigration officials will be able to deny legal immigrants visas if they are deemed ""more likely than not"" to use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are in the United States legally on temporary visas and have relied on such benefits in the past could also have more difficulty getting a green card.
The rule will not affect people who already have green cards, refugees and asylum-seekers, as well as certain members of the military, pregnant women and children.
The Trump administration has defended the move as preserving public benefits for eligible U.S. citizens and promoting self-sufficiency in immigrants to the United States.
But Gelatt said the rule could be used to deny many more green card applicants than before and, as a consequence, ""have dramatic impacts on the level of legal immigration to the country, and on the characteristics of legal immigrants.""
Kevin Johnson, dean of UC Davis School of Law, noted that the enforcement of immigration laws has already changed drastically under Trump. 
He said the number of visa denials for Mexican immigrants has ""skyrocketed,"" pointing to a Politico report that said the State Department denied 5,343 visa requests from Mexican immigrants on public charge grounds between Oct. 1 and July 29.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not weigh in on the accuracy of Schmitt’s claim, but the agency’s press office told us: ""Public charge has been a part of U.S. immigration law for more than 100 years, appearing as far back as the Immigration Act of 1882, as a ground of inadmissibility, and has existed in its current form since 1996.""
Our ruling
Schmitt said, ""This rule has been around for a while. This is not a new thing that the president is trying to implement here, that the United States has been this way.""
Public charge as a standard of inadmissibility has been a staple of immigration law since 1882. But Trump’s new policy will significantly change the way immigration officials decide which legal immigrants should be disqualified from getting visas or green cards.
The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate it Half True."
13,A photograph shows Joe Biden with a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.,"on Thursday, August 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/15/viral-image/robert-byrd-wasnt-grand-wizard-kkk-he-once-led-loc/,Mostly False,Viral image,Robert Byrd wasn’t a Grand Wizard of the KKK but he once led a local chapter | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"An old photograph of former Vice President Joe Biden has been circulating online as some social media users try to tie the Democratic presidential candidate to the KKK.  
""Biden with the Grand wizard of the KKK,"" the Aug. 9 post says. ""So who again is playing you, lying to you, using you for the votes, Creators of the KKK, opposed civil right (sic) of blacks. Yup thats (sic) the Democratic party.""
The black and white photo beneath the words shows Biden holding hands with then-Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who the post identifies as a ""KKK leader.""
The post, which had been shared more than 1,400 times by Aug. 15, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The image is authentic. It was shot by Associated Press photographer Bob Bird in October 2008 as Biden, then a Democratic senator from Delaware and Barack Obama’s Democratic vice presidential candidate, attended a campaign rally in downtown Charleston, W. Va. Also in the photo are the state’s then-Gov. Joe Manchin and then-U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, also a West Virginia Democrat.
When Byrd died in 2010, he had served in the Senate longer than anyone else; the New York Times described him as ""a pillar of Capitol Hill."" In a statement, then-President Barack Obama called him ""a voice of principle and reason."" Biden said Byrd was ""a dear friend.""
He was also once a member of the Ku Klux Klan. 
""It has emerged throughout my life to haunt and embarrass me and has taught me in a very graphic way what one major mistake can do to one’s life, career, and reputation,"" Byrd wrote in a 2005 memoir. 
In West Virginia in the 1940s — late 1941 or early 1942, according to Byrd’s memoir — he organized and led a 150-member chapter, or ""Klavern,"" of the Klan as the ""Exalted Cyclops."" In Klan hierarchy, according to Slate, each Klavern is led by an Exalted Cyclops typically elected by his fellow Klansmen. The Exalted Cyclops reports to a ""Grand Giant"" (provincial leader), ""Grand Dragon"" (state director) and ""Grand Wizard"" (national chair). 
In his book, Byrd says he worked as a recruiter, or ""Kleagle,"" for the Klan until early 1943 and then left the state for a welding job in Baltimore. He returned to West Virginia after World War II ended and sent a letter in 1945 to Theodore Bilbo, a Democratic senator and segregationist from Mississippi, complaining about efforts to integrate the military. 
""Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels,"" he wrote.  
He was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates the following year and again in 1948. In 1950, he was elected to the state Senate and in 1952, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. It was then that political opponents revealed his former ties to the KKK, according to a 2005 article in the Washington Post titled ""A Senator’s Shame."" Byrd acknowledged he belonged to the Klan from ""mid-1942 to early 1943"" and said he joined ""because it offered excitement and because it was strongly opposed to communism."" 
He said he quit after a year but contemporaneous newspaper accounts and letters show that Byrd was involved with the Klan throughout much of the 1940s, according to the Washington Post. In 1946, for example, he said in a letter to the Grand Wizard that ""the Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia.""
Still, Byrd won his election and ""then spent decades apologizing for what he called a ‘sad mistake,’"" according to the Times. His civil rights record is mixed. He voted for civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 but he filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act because he said the measure infringed on states’ rights. He said he voted against the 1965 Voting Rights Acts and its renewal in 1970 for the same reason. After becoming a party leader, he consistently supported civil rights legislation and he backed Obama’s presidential bid, as seen in the photo used in the Facebook post. 
Our ruling
The Facebook post claims that Joe Biden was photographed with Robert Byrd, Grand Wizard of the KKK. That exaggerates Byrd’s role in the KKK.  
In the 1940s, Byrd organized and led a local Klan chapter as its Exalted Cyclops, but he wasn’t a Grand Wizard. And he ultimately renounced his views from that period of his life though his past and former ties to the KKK were raised throughout the rest of his life.
By the time this photo of Byrd and Biden was taken, Byrd’s public expressions of regret and shame over his earlier involvement in the KKK was well-documented and often-repeated.   
We rate this Facebook post Mostly False."

He touted the economic improvements on his watch, from growing steel production to rising energy sales. Trump launched into an anecdote of sorts that painted a picture of a turnaround in trade with Japan. 
""I told Prime Minister Abe — great guy — I said, ‘Listen, we have a massive deficit with Japan.’ They send thousands and thousands — millions — of cars. We send them wheat. Wheat. That’s not a good deal. And they don’t even want our wheat. They do it because they want us to at least feel that we’re okay. You know, they do it to make us feel good.
""But the deficit is massive, which is changing rapidly. But what they're doing is, they're buying a lot of our stuff, including our military equipment.""
We’ll check the accuracy of each main point.
""They send thousands and thousands — millions — of cars.""
Trump inflates the total, but not by much. The U.S. Trade Administration says Japan sent about 1.7 million new cars and light trucks to the United States in 2018.
""We send them wheat.""
Well, the United States does export wheat to Japan, but Trump makes it sound as though this is a large share of U.S.-Japan trade. It isn’t. 
In 2018, wheat represented less than 1% of total U.S. sales to Japan. Corn brought in many more dollars — $2.8 billion compared to $0.7 billion from wheat.
The top ranking U.S. product (based on dollar value) was civilian aircraft, engines, equipment, and parts, which produced $5.6 billion in sales. Industrial machines and liquified natural gas came in second and third, each with about $4.5 billion in sales.
Wheat ranked 32nd.

With the exception of liquefied natural gas sales, which took off in 2016, the sales numbers for aircraft, industrial machinery and other leading products have been fairly steady over time.
Trump also singled out sales of military equipment. All told, it accounted for about 1.8% of total sales to Japan. No type of military product ranked higher than 26th.
""The deficit is massive, which is changing rapidly.""
The overall trade deficit with Japan in goods and services has stayed relatively level at about $57 billion a year since 2016. But not only is it not changing quickly, it rose slightly each year. 
The most recent data runs through the first quarter of 2019. Comparing just the first quarters in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 shows a rise from $13.7 billion in 2016 to $15.5 billion in 2019.

We reached out to the White House and they had no comment.
Our ruling
Trump talked about U.S.-Japan trade in terms of Americans buying Japanese cars while the Japanese bought American wheat. He also said the trade deficit is changing rapidly.
Trump distorted the actual trade relations in many ways. While he was reasonably correct on the scale of cars imported to the United States, he cast wheat as a major part of U.S.-Japan trade. It accounts for less than 1% of sales. Trump sidestepped the top ranking items of civilian aircraft and related goods, and industrial machinery. 
The numbers also undercut his implication that the trade deficit is changing rapidly for the better. It has held steady, although getting a bit worse each year.
Trump was close on the car and truck imports, but missed the mark in every other respect. We rate this claim Mostly False."
13,Says the late Lady Bird Johnson sicced the CIA on actress and singer Eartha Kitt after Kitt spoke out against the Vietnam War during a White House luncheon in January 1968.,"on Thursday, August 15th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/aug/15/drunk-history/did-lady-bird-johnson-sic-cia-eartha-kitt/,Mostly False,Drunk History,Did Lady Bird Johnson sic the CIA on Eartha Kitt? | PolitiFact Texas,"During an episode of Comedy Central’s ""Drunk History,"" comedian Nicole Byer described a conflict between the late Lady Bird Johnson and actress and singer Eartha Kitt when Johnson was first lady.
During a July 2 episode, Byer said:
""Lady Bird calls the CIA and she goes, 'Yo listen, this b----? I don't like this b----. You better find everything you can about her so I can send it to other people so she doesn't work. Lady Bird is just like, ‘Destroy her,’ "" Byer said.
We had to know whether Byer’s description of Texas icon Lady Bird Johnson was accurate. Comedy Central did not return a request for more information, so we consulted archival news coverage and spoke with historians to check this claim.
First, let’s set the scene
Kitt was one of 50 women invited to the White House on Jan. 18, 1968, for a ""Women Doer's Luncheon"" to discuss crime among young people, according to a Jan. 19, 1968, New York Times story.
Johnson frequently recorded her thoughts and reflections throughout her husband Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, according to the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum. A transcript from a Jan. 18, 1968, recording details the day of the luncheon.
Other women in attendance included governors’ wives, senators’ wives, journalists, and members of the National Emergency Committee on the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, according to Johnson’s audio diary.
Both President Lyndon Johnson and the first lady were at the luncheon. When Kitt rose to speak, she offered a sharp condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to the New York Times story.
In her audio diary, Lady Bird Johnson said that Kitt took a step toward her, ""looking with intense directness at me,"" when she offered her critique.
""You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed,"" Kitt said during the luncheon, according to the Times. ""They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don’t want to go to school because they’re going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.""
Johnson said Kitt’s speech stunned the room into silence.

Kitt wasn't the only entertainment icon to criticize the Johnson administration over the Vietnam War. Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ Presidential Library, said journalist Walter Cronkite and actress Jane Fonda were among the public figures who spoke out against the war.
Kitt’s comments were well documented in the press, as they caused quite a commotion.
An anonymous letter to the first lady on Jan. 22, 1968, included racist language about Kitt and said she ""defiled the White House and made us all ashamed.""
A woman named Clarence Nowack left a message for Johnson on Jan. 20, 1968, to say she was proud of her son for volunteering to serve in the war, where he was killed.
Warren E. Burger, then a federal appellate judge who would be named a year later to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a Jan. 19, 1968, letter to Johnson that he and his wife were proud of how she composed herself during the luncheon.
""The unhappy episode at your recent luncheon impells me to write you to say that Mrs. Burger and I took a deep pride in the courage and composure you exhibited in the face of a gross breach of your hospitality and of good elementary manners,"" Burger said.
A letter to the editor published on Jan. 27, 1968, in the Times said in part: ""There are even a few of us who believe that it is not really decent, or fair, to attack a man by insulting and humiliating his wife in the presence of other guests and the press.""
Kitt told the Times, according to a Jan. 23, 1968, article, that she had received telegrams, phone calls and mail from supporters who agreed with what she had said.
Kitt later said in a June 7, 2006, video interview that she had not realized that the debacle at the White House affected her career until investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called her about the CIA’s file on her.
""I didn’t realize I was being rejected in the United States and I couldn’t find work. I thought maybe my popularity is waning, my records sales are not up,"" Kitt said.
Exploring the conflict with the CIA
Byer said Johnson asked the CIA to find damaging information on Kitt after the luncheon. We couldn’t find evidence of this direct request.
But the Secret Service did request information about Kitt from the CIA the day after the women’s luncheon, according to Hersh's Jan. 3, 1975, story in the Times. Historians say it is unclear who directed the Secret Service to make the request.
Secret Service officials said they asked the CIA for information on Kitt to see if she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times.
The CIA gave a three-page report on Kitt to the Secret Service, a file the agency had maintained since at least 1956, because Kitt had done work overseas, the Times reported.
The report stated that Kitt had a ""very nasty disposition"" and described her as ""being a spoiled child, very crude and having a vile tongue.""
We submitted an open records request to the CIA seeking the information in the report. The CIA responded:
""we did not locate any responsive records that would reveal a publicly acknowledged CIA affiliation with the subject.""
John Wilson, an archivist at the LBJ Presidential Library, said he doubts Lady Bird Johnson would have asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she would not have put it in writing.
""As far as actual power, first ladies don’t have very much, but people would tend to listen, I would think,"" Wilson said. ""Whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she did ask them informally, they would be a lot more likely to pay attention.""
Gillette said that Johnson would not have wanted to fan the flames around the Kitt incident.
""I knew her a long time and I knew a lot of people who knew her better than I did, and that’s so out of character for her that it’s almost laughable,"" Gillette said.
Our ruling
""Drunk History"" claimed former first lady Lady Bird Johnson demanded the CIA find damning information on singer Eartha Kitt.
While the Secret Service did request information from the CIA following the luncheon, there is no evidence to support the idea that Lady Bird Johnson asked for the information. The Secret Service said the request was made for security purposes, not to ""destroy her.""
We rate this claim Mostly False.

13,"""The vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless people ""also come in from — and we know this — from Texas. Just (an) interesting fact.""","on Wednesday, August 14th, 2019",http://politifact.com/california/statements/2019/aug/14/gavin-newsom/gavin-newsoms-ridiculous-claim-texas-responsible-s/,Pants on Fire!,Gavin Newsom,Gavin Newsom’s ridiculous claim: ‘Vast majority’ of San Francisco’s homeless people come from Texas | PolitiFact Californ,"There are many reasons for San Francisco’s homelessness crisis: Gentrification. Job losses. Evictions. Mental health and substance abuse struggles. But … Texas? 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently blamed the Lone Star State for somehow producing the bulk of the city’s homeless population. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco from January 2004 through January 2011. 
The Democratic governor was asked during a June interview on ""Axios on HBO"" why San Francisco’s homeless population did not experience a net decline during his tenure as mayor. Newsom said most of the homeless people on the street when he left office were not from California, but added ""we took responsibility"" for them. 
He then made the head-scratching claim about Texas. 
""The vast majority (of San Francisco’s homeless people) also come in from — and we know this — from Texas. Just (an) interesting fact,"" Newsom said. 
San Francisco has struggled for decades with a large homeless population, which reached 8,011 in January — up 17 percent from two years ago, according to the city’s most recent point in time count. 
We examined Newsom’s mayoral record on homelessness in a previous fact check. And we’re tracking his gubernatorial campaign promise to tackle the issue statewide through our Newsom-Meter project. 
The Los Angeles Times first pointed out Newsom’s questionable statement about Texas, leading the California Republican Party to later call it ""a baseless claim."" 
We decided to dig in for our own fact check. 
Our research
Newsom’s statement is contradicted by San Francisco’s own point in time homeless counts. Those reports are conducted every two years. 
They consistently show a large majority of people surveyed said they lived in San Francisco prior to becoming homeless. 
A smaller share said they lived in another California county. Often the smallest percentage said they lived out of state before becoming homeless in San Francisco. 
The 2019 report found 70 percent had lived in the city; 22 percent in another California county and 8 percent out-of-state. Of that 70 percent, more than half, or 55 percent, reported living in San Francisco for a decade or more before losing their home. Just 6 percent said they had lived in the city for less than a year. 
Going back a dozen years, the city’s 2007 point-in-time count shows 62 percent reported being from San Francisco; about 16 percent were from outside the state and 15 percent were from another county in the state.
""The data shows (Newsom’s statement) is completely and totally incorrect,"" said Jennifer Friedenback, executive director of San Francisco-based Coalition of Homelessness. ""Newsom knows better, by the way.""

Newsom’s response
To support the claim, a spokesman for Newsom provided data from San Francisco’s Homeward Bound, a program that gives homeless people bus tickets to travel to friends or family within or outside the state who have agreed to take them in. Some homeless advocacy groups have criticized it as simply moving the problem elsewhere.
The data includes travel destinations for the program from 2004 through 2018. It shows approximately 20 percent of Homeward Bound’s trips, or about 2,400, took place inside California during that period. About 80 percent took place out of state. 
Texas was the most popular destination outside of California, with 827 trips or 6.7 percent of the program’s 12,268 trips since it started. The next most popular were Washington state, at 5.8 percent, and Florida, at 5.4 percent.
At 6.7 percent, Texas in no way can be described as accounting for ""the vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless population. It also doesn't mean all those who took a trip to Texas were necessarily from that state. 
All it means is ""you have someone you can stay with"" in that state, not that you were born or raised there, Friedenbach noted. She added that some African Americans who have been displaced and left homeless in San Francisco in recent years have family ties in Texas or other southern states, but did not necessarily grow up there. 
Homeward Bound’s requirements say nothing about needing to be from a particular state. 
Here’s what they do say:
""The Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing can provide you with a bus ticket home if you: are homeless/low income and living in San Francisco; and have family or friends at the destination that Homeward Bound staff can verify as willing and able to provide you a place to stay and ongoing support; and are medically stable enough to travel unassisted to the destination; and are sober and able to abstain from alcohol or using other substances en route.""
Calls to San Francisco’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing were not returned. 
Our ruling
California Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed the ""vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless people come in from Texas.
San Francisco’s own homeless surveys contradict this. They show a large majority reported living in the city before becoming homeless, and just a fraction coming in from out-of-state. 
Newsom’s office pointed to data from San Francisco’s bus ticket program for homeless people. But that defense doesn’t hold up. It shows just a small fraction, less than 7 percent, left for Texas, and doesn’t demonstrate that they originally came to San Francisco from that state. 
In the end, we found Newsom made a ridiculous claim. 
We rated it Pants on Fire.

13,"Law-abiding gun owners stop crimes ""2.5 million times a year,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.","on Wednesday, August 14th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/aug/14/curt-schilling/trump-backed-ex-pitcher-curt-schilling-misleads-sa/,Mostly False,Curt Schilling,Trump-backed ex-pitcher Curt Schilling misleads saying self-defense gun use stops 2.5 million crimes | Pund,"Curt Schilling, a former Major League Baseball pitcher and former ESPN commentator known for controversial views, says he is considering a run for Congress in Arizona. The news quickly drew a cheer from President Donald Trump.
Three days earlier, Schilling threw a fastball of a claim about guns that caught our attention.
A TV reporter in Charlotte, N.C., had tweeted that an armed patron with a concealed carry permit shot two armed robbery suspects at a 7-Eleven, killing one of them.
A sales manager for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association responded with a tweet saying, ""You mean to tell me a law-abiding, responsible gun owner actually DID stop crime?""
Schilling replied to that tweet with a reference to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying:
""Happens 2.5 million times a year per the CDC.""
That’s actually not a count but an estimate, on the higher end, and it wasn’t done by the CDC.
Schilling’s evidence
A spokesman for Cameo, a service Schilling promotes on his Twitter profile that pays him and other celebrities to create ""personalized video shoutouts"" for purchase, said he could not forward our request to Schilling for information that would back up his statement. 
However, responding to a critic on Twitter, Schilling cited an opinion article on Forbes.com, which in turn references a 2013 report.
The report was requested by the CDC, but was done by what is now known as the National Academy of Medicine, a federally chartered nonprofit. 
The report did not produce its own estimates; rather, it cited estimates from studies.
It also made clear that estimates vary widely.
""Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed,"" ranging from 108,000 to 3 million instances per year, the report stated. 
Both the 3 million figure, and a 2.5 million figure mentioned in the report, stem from one gun researcher, Florida State University criminal justice professor Gary Kleck.
The high estimates
Kleck said in an interview with PolitiFact that the 2.5 million comes not from the CDC but from a national survey he and Florida State colleague Marc Gertz did in 1993, asking a random sample of adults if they had used a gun in ""self-protection"" or in protection of property in the past year, and how they had used it. 
So, that’s a survey that is 26 years old.
The study estimated that Americans use guns for self-protection — that is, the person using the gun, though not necessarily firing it, believed that a crime, such as burglary or assault, was being committed — up to 2.5 million times per year.
Kleck also provided us a 2018 article he wrote summarizing the findings of 20 other surveys that asked at least one question about defensive gun use. The ""implied number"" of defensive gun use incidents ranged from 600,000 to 6.1 million per year, according to the article. 
Other gun researchers we contacted view Kleck’s 2.5 million estimate as extremely high. 
Surveying people about events that rarely occur always produces overestimates, said Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway.
The best survey of crime is the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Justice Department and the Census Bureau since 1973, Duke University professor of public policy studies Philip Cook told us.
""There are subtle differences"" between it and Kleck’s survey, in how questions about self-defense are asked, ""but the difference in the resulting estimate of how often guns are used in self-defense is huge,"" he said. In recent years, the NCVS-based estimate is less than 100,000 per year, Cook said.
Both figures have their critics.
The 2.5 million is ""not plausible given other information that is more trustworthy, such as the total number of U.S. residents who are injured or killed by guns each year,"" the RAND Corp. said in a 2018 analysis. ""At the other extreme, the NCVS ""almost certainly underestimates the true number.""
Kleck criticized the NCVS estimates as ""wildly out of line"" with other estimates because its surveys only ask crime victims whether they tried to protect themselves, which means those who used a gun would have to ""volunteer"" that information.
Our ruling
Schilling said law-abiding gun owners stop crimes ""2.5 million times a year,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
The number of such instances is not known, and no estimate has been done by the CDC.
A report requested by the CDC cites various studies, including one by a Florida State University gun researcher based on a 1993 survey which estimates that people use guns about 2.5 million times per year in self-defense, when they believe a crime is being committed. 
That study did not try to determine whether the people in those instances were actual gun owners or whether they were law abiding during the incident. But the researcher says studies as recently as 2018 have produced estimates as high as 6.1 million.
Other gun researchers, however, say 2.5 million is an extremely high estimate. They point to surveys that estimate about 100,000 such incidents per year.
The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False."

""Not one Democrat called for Gun Control.""   
This post, which had been shared more than 7,000 times by Aug. 8, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what you should know.
U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, then the House majority whip, and four others were wounded when Hodgkinson shot at them during their baseball practice. Hodgkinson, who was angry with President Donald Trump and posted rants against Republicans online, was killed by police.
In the weeks after, conservative lawmakers called to loosen gun restrictions. Republicans introduced legislation to allow lawmakers to almost always carry a concealed weapon and to allow concealed carry permits obtained in other states to be recognized in the District of Columbia, the New York Times then reported.
Democrats opposed the measures. U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the House’s nonvoting member from D.C., said it ""is the last place you want to condone or allow concealed-carry weapons"" and ""they are certainly not going to be successful if I have anything to say about it."" 
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Rahm Emanuel, then Chicago’s mayor, among other Democrats, offered a resolution as part of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to oppose concealed carry bills.
Rep. Joe Crowley, then the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said arming lawmakers was not the solution to improve congressional safety. ""It makes it very difficult to slide into second base when you have a pistol on your side,"" he said.
Other Democrats explicitly called for more gun control after the shooting. 
Terry McAuliffe, then the Democratic governor of Virginia, called for more background checks and closing the ""gun-show loophole,"" according to USA Today. 
NBC News noted that some Democrats were quick ""to use the incident to call for new gun restrictions opposed by many in the GOP."" 
""Democratic State Rep. Mark Levine, who represents Alexandria, let his voice rise as he ticked through the gun control legislation that Republicans have blocked in the Virginia General Assembly,"" the NBC story said.
Much of the coverage in the Alexandria shooting’s aftermath focused on partisanship and rhetoric and accusations that both sides of the aisle were fueling discord across the country. As Republicans introduced legislation to loosen gun control restrictions, Democrats pushed back, and some called for more restrictions.

We’ll cut to the chase: The photo of patient is in the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, not El Paso. Our reporting shows she is a survivor of the mass shooting outside a bar in Dayton on Aug. 4 that left 10 people dead, including the suspect. She is an adult, though, not a little girl as the Facebook post suggests, and there is no evidence that she is a crisis actor, much less the daughter of a Trump appointee. 
The first photo was published among others on The White House’s Instagram page on Aug. 7 with this caption: ""The President and First lady met with survivors and family members in Dayton, Ohio, this afternoon.""
Sharon Howard, a spokesperson for the Miami Valley Hospital, would not comment directly on the Facebook post’s allegations. But she told us that all of the hospital’s patients are adults and all of the photos the White House released following the president’s visit are legitimate. 
While Trump was at the hospital, Howard said, he met with the three patients who were still checked in following the shooting, and he met with their families, first responders and the medical team that treated the patients. 
He did not meet with any other patients while he was there, she said. 
Ivanka Trump posted the second photo on Twitter on Aug. 7 and tweeted: ""Thank you @WHAAsstSecty Kim Breier for your friendship and service. While Jared and I will miss working with you, we are happy that Emma will now get to see more of the mom she is so proud of!"" 
On Facebook, Ivanka Trump’s photo was cropped to exclude the image of Kimberly Breier, the assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere, who resigned this month.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.
The photo, published Aug. 1 by a conservative Facebook page called Tactical Hospitality, makes a variety of claims about Omar, some of which are related to previous fact-checks about her family history and comments about al-Qaida.
Two claims were new to us: The post said Omar has been ""arrested 23 times"" and is the ""daughter of (a) Somali terrorist.""
""From jail cell, to Congress,"" claims the photo, which includes images of Omar’s purported mugshot and another of her being sworn in as a congresswoman.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
PolitiFact reached out to Tactical Hospitality to see where it got the image. The page told us that it ""grabbed it from an individual whom shared it"" and that it wasn’t sure of the origin.
When we looked into the claims, we found that Omar has not been arrested 23 times and there’s no evidence to suggest either of her parents are involved with terrorist organizations.
A 2013 arrest
We checked public records and found that Omar was arrested once — not 23 times. The Facebook post conflated the congresswoman’s traffic violations with arrests. 
Snopes fact-checked a related claim that the representative ""was arrested in 2013 for trespassing."" The post included the same mugshot pictured in the photo that Tactical Hospitality shared. Snopes rated that statement true.
The fact-checker pointed to a police report from January 2013. It says Omar was arrested on two misdemeanor charges for trespassing and refusing to leave a Minneapolis hotel. She was booked into Hennepin County Jail. She was 30.
Omar’s trespassing charges were later dropped, the Associated Press reported in October. The congresswoman refused to leave a hotel lobby that was filled with people following the Somali president, who was in town to give a speech. Omar snuck back in and after police cleared the lobby.
PolitiFact could not find the incident in a public database of Minnesota court records. Her campaign did not comment.
Parking tickets
What we did find in the database were 24 traffic violations from the past 10 years, the most recent being a parking ticket from January, in which Omar was convicted of a petty misdemeanor for parking ""overtime in a meter zone."" Under Minnesota law, a conviction means ""a plea of guilty; or a verdict of guilty by a jury or a finding of guilty by the court.""
The other 23 charges include several such parking violations, as well as two expired plates and one speeding ticket. In winter 2016, Omar paid two tickets for not following ""snow emergency parking restrictions,"" which set specific times in which drivers cannot park on certain roads.
Jail time is not listed for any of those traffic violations — and being charged with petty misdemeanors is not the same as being arrested.
PolitiFact reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more details about Omar’s record. The MPD’s Records Information Unit sent us a document indicating that Omar had only been arrested once — in 2013 for the trespassing charge.
Omar’s parents
The second claim in the Facebook post is much more serious, alleging that Omar is the daughter of a Somali terrorist.
A spokesman for Omar’s office sent two articles with biographical information about Omar, without further elaboration.
City Pages, an alternative newspaper in the Twin Cities, reported in November 2016 that Omar’s mother died when she was little. And, before civil war broke out in the early 1990s, her father trained teachers in Somalia. 
The family was sent to a refugee camp in Kenya during the conflict, The Washington Post reported July 6. They were granted U.S. asylum in 1995, eventually settling in Minneapolis, where Omar’s father worked as a cab driver and, later, at a post office.
We could not find any evidence that either of Omar’s parents were terrorists or war criminals in Somalia.
Snopes similarly could not determine whether Omar’s father, Nur Omar Mohamed, was a ""war criminal"" in Somalia, as The Gateway Pundit claimed, for a July 25 fact check.
The conservative news site, which PolitiFact has fact-checked in the past, reported July 16 that Omar’s father was connected to Siad Barre, president of Somalia from 1969 to 1991. But, as Snopes noted, The Gateway Pundit didn’t offer proof of this. Instead, the site mentioned another man, Yusuf Abdi Ali, and claimed — without evidence — that the two were connected. (Here’s more about him from a CNN report.)
Our ruling
A viral photo on Facebook claims that Ilhan Omar has been arrested 23 times and is the daughter of a Somali terrorist.
She was arrested once and the charges were dropped. Minnesota court records show that Omar has had 24 traffic violations in the past 10 years, not arrests. We could not find any evidence that either of Omar’s parents were involved in a terrorist organization in Somalia.

The connection between the energy drink company and President Trump is not as direct as this rumor makes it out to be.
A viral Facebook post shared Aug. 5 has amassed more than 500 comments and 3,600 shares. It features an image of a Bang energy drink with someone holding up their middle finger in front of it. The body of the post reads,""Didn’t know but just found this out that every-time you purchased a bang a portion of your money helps re-election Donald Trump & goes to the fund campaign for MAGA!

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
No, a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase does not directly fund Trump’s re-election efforts, but the parent company of Bang — Vital Pharmeceuticals — did donate a large sum of money to a pro-Trump PAC.
The rumor started after Axios published a story on July 31, 2019, that reported pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and its affiliated nonprofit, America First Policies, raised nearly $18 million in the first half of 2019.
The story identified some of the committee’s top donors: real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer gave $2 million, former Small Business Administration leader and wrestling executive Linda McMahon gave $1 million, and Vital Pharmaceuticals donated $250,000. According to Federal Election Commission filings, it is the only contribution the company has made.
The website Popular Info picked up on the Bang-Vital Pharmaceuticals connection from the report and published a subsequent story on Aug. 1 with the headline, ""Every can of this energy drink helps Trump get re-elected.""
It didn’t take long for the claim to spill over into social media posts of former Bang devotees saying they are giving up the energy drink because of its political affiliation.
But the story and social media posts overstate the energy drink’s connection to Trump’s re-election campaign or related PACs. Yes, its parent company donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, but there is no direct distribution from a portion of every energy drink purchased. Neither Bang’s website nor its social media accounts advertise any kind of political fundraising campaign. PolitiFact also reached out to the company, but did not immediately hear back.
However, Vital Pharmaceuticals CEO and Bang energy drink founder Jack Owoc and his wife Meg Liz Owoc have been outspoken in their support for Trump in the past.
@realDonaldTrump Your brilliance has fueled the most epic turn of events in the history of politics. God bless the inevitable – Trump wins!— Jack Owoc (@BangEnergyCEO) March 14, 2016 
#TrumpAddress I LOVE MY PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump 🇺🇸❤️— Meg Liz Owoc (@MegLizOwoc) January 9, 2019 
It can be argued that the energy drink’s sales may have boosted the amount the parent company chose to donate and could help fuel future donations, but it is inaccurate to say a portion of each Bang energy drink purchase directly funds Trump’s re-election campaign or other Trump 2020 efforts.
The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Mostly False."
13,"""If you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying in front of Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago.""","on Tuesday, August 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/13/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-correct-nras-wayne-lapierre-once-support/,True,Michael Bloomberg,Bloomberg correct that NRA’s Wayne LaPierre once supported background checks,"Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg took a familiar swipe at NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre during an Aug. 11 interview on CBS’s ""Face the Nation.""
Host Margaret Brennan asked Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, if he thought the NRA would be able to ""bankroll"" in 2020 like it did in 2016, when it gave millions to President Donald Trump’s campaign.
Numerous mass shootings have taken place since Trump’s election, including two in the span of 24 hours last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.
""I think the NRA has been very badly hurt by this,"" Bloomberg said. ""Ninety percent of NRA members are in favor of background checks, so the NRA is not in the place of most of its members. And in fact, if you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago.""
Related: ""Do majority of NRA members support background checks for guns?""
Bloomberg made almost the exact same claim about LaPierre’s testimony in 2013. Former President Barack Obama did, too. 
It’s still accurate.
We wanted to revisit the history in light of the NRA’s typically staunch resistance to gun control efforts and the Washington Post’s recent report that LaPierre called Trump to warn against pushing for background checks. 
On May 27, 1999, a month after the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime.
LaPierre, also the chief executive at that time, listed a number of gun-related actions and laws the group believed would be ""reasonable."" Mandatory background checks for guns at gun shows was one.
""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show,"" he said. ""No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" 
""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system,"" he continued. ""This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.""
""We think it’s reasonable to provide for instant gun checks at shows, just like at gun stores and pawn shops,"" LaPierre said, echoing a message at the heart of an NRA advertising campaign from that year. 
In 2013, LaPierre and the NRA acknowledged the change in position.
In a January Senate hearing that year — this time following a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — LaPierre was asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about his 1999 testimony on background checks.
Leahy asked if the United States should ""have mandatory background checks at gun shows for sales of weapons.""
""Senator, I do not believe, the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors,"" LaPierre said.
In response to a follow-up, he added: ""We do not (support mandatory background checks at gun shows), because the fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it’s working.""
Also in January 2013, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work.""
Plus, on March 12, 2013, the NRA signaled its opposition to background checks on its website: ""The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system.""
Our ruling
Bloomberg said, ""If you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago.""
In 1999 testimony before Congress, LaPierre said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show.""
Subsequent statements from LaPierre and other NRA officials have acknowledged that the organization’s position on background checks has since changed.
We rate Bloomberg’s statement True."
13,"""More Americans are uninsured today than when (President Donald) Trump took office.""","on Tuesday, August 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/aug/13/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-baldwin-right-more-americans-are-without-he/,True,Tammy Baldwin,Is U.S. Sen. Baldwin right that more Americans are without health insurance? | PolitiFact Wisconsin,"The Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, by President Barack Obama, has been a political lightning rod from the beginning.
The ACA’s subsidies made it possible for more Americans to buy health insurance in the newly-created marketplaces or directly from insurance companies, or to be covered through Medicaid. 
But, according to some Democrats, those gains in coverage are being lost.
""The Trump administration is attacking our health care system and raising health care costs for families,""  U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said in a June 24, 2019, tweet. ""More Americans are uninsured today than when (President Donald) Trump took office.""
Is Baldwin correct? Are more Americans uninsured today than when Trump took office? 
Let’s take a look.
The evidence
When asked to back up the statement, Baldwin’s staff provided a list of links to academic studies, polls and media reports. In many cases, the headlines tell the story:
— Jan. 23, 2019, Gallup report: ""U.S. Uninsured Rate Rises to Four-Year High.""
— April 25, 2019, Georgetown University Health Policy Institute: ""Updated CBO Estimates Find Uninsured Increased by 1.4 Million Between 2016 and 2018.""
— Jan. 23, 2019, Forbes: ""Uninsured rate hits four-year high amid Trump’s Obamacare attacks."" 
— May 9, 2019, USA Today: ""CDC: 1.1 million more American lost health insurance coverage in 2018."" 
— Jan. 23, 2019, Los Angeles Times: ""Uninsured rate under Trump surges to highest level since Obamacare began."" 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics report on health insurance shows there were 28.6 million people uninsured in 2016, the year before Trump took office. That represents 9% of the population.
In 2018, that number showed 30.4 million people, or 9.4% of people all ages were without insurance. 
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
The numbers of uninsured had been in decline but now are beginning to tick  upward. So, Baldwin is in the ball park with the ""more Americans"" part of the statement. 
But her claim ties the reduction in those with insurance to actions by Trump and his administration. How does she fare in that regard?
Administration actions
Trump campaigned on the issue of repealing the ACA. Since taking office in January of 2017, his administration has steadily taken steps to roll back the law.
On Jan. 20, 2017, Trump issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to use their administrative powers to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act ""to the maximum extent permitted by law."" 
Currently, a federal appeals court in New Orleans has taken up the Affordable Care Act case, Texas v. United States, which has been brought by Republican-led states. A lower court judge already ruled the health law unconstitutional. The case could wind up before the Supreme Court, which in 2012 upheld the law saying its requirement that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty was covered by Congress’ ability to levy taxes.
Meanwhile, a July 7, 2019 CNN article headlined ""5 ways Trump is undermining Obamacare without the courts"" noted the administration has:
Made it harder to sign up: That is, Trump cut the enrollment period in half and cut advertising about how to sign up.
Broadened access to alternative plans: An October 2017 executive order allows more people to buy cheaper policies -- though ones with less coverage and fewer protections.
Made enrollees pay more: Among other factors, moves that change how some of the law's provisions are adjusted every year mean policyholders will have to pay 2.5% more out of pocket.
Let states alter Obamacare:  States, including Wisconsin, have applied for waivers so they do not have to apply parts of the law.
Required Medicaid recipients to work: As the CNN article notes: ""The Trump administration is allowing states to require certain Medicaid enrollees -- particularly those who gained coverage under Obamacare -- to work in order to continue receiving benefits.""
Meanwhile, on March 28, 2019, PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro, who said Trump’s health care policies have ""left millions more Americans uninsured since he took office.""
Castro’s claim specifically said ""millions,"" which differs from Baldwin’s much more general claim. At the time, the number was actually closer to 1.3 million. PolitiFact National concluded Castro had the trend right, but his numbers wrong, and rated his claim Half True.
Our ruling
Baldwin said ""more Americans are uninsured today than when Trump took office."" 
Census Bureau statistics show that there was a steady decline in the number of uninsured Americans following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- a trend that reversed and began ticking upward under Trump.
We rate Baldwin’s statement True."
13,"""Criminals don’t go through (gun) background checks. I think it’s like 3% go through a background check.""","on Tuesday, August 13th, 2019",http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/aug/13/philip-van-cleave/van-cleave-ballpark-criminals-who-had-gun-backgrou/,Mostly True,Philip Van Cleave,Van Cleave in ballpark on criminals who had gun background checks | PolitiFact Virgin,"Beefing up background checks on gun buyers won’t reduce crime, says Philip Van Cleave, a Virginia gun lobbyist.
Van Cleave is president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. During an Aug. 8 interview on WRVA Radio in Richmond, he was dismissive of calls for stronger background checks in the wake of fatal mass shootings this year in Virginia and other states.
""Criminals don’t go through background checks,"" he said. ""I think it’s like 3% go through a background check - 3%. Ninety-seven percent get the guns on the street.""
We fact-checked Van Cleave’s claim. 
Democrats in Virginia’s General Assembly and in Congress are calling for tighter background checks. Virginia and federal laws require all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to run computerized checks to see if buyers have disqualifying criminal or mental health records. But gun sales between individuals not in the business - say, neighbors or hobbyists - are exempt.
President Donald Trump has recently said he supports stronger background checks, but has not specified what changes he favors. 
Van Cleave told us his 3% statistic comes from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal prisoners by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The bureau reported its findings in January 2019. 
Of the inmates, 21% said they used or possessed a firearm while committing the crime that put them in prison, or about 5,200 of the sample, according to our calculation (the study did not break down its percentages into numbers of inmates). Of the prisoners who used or possessed a gun during the crime:

•43%, or about 2,240, said they got the firearm ""off the street or underground market.""
•25% - about 1,300 - said they bought or rented the gun from a relative or friend, or got it as a gift.
•6% - about 310 - said they stole the gun.
•10% - about 520 - said they bought the weapon at a retail outlet: a gun store, pawn shop, flea market or gun show. The rest got their guns by other means.

Now, let’s focus on the 10% who bought their guns from a retailer. They’re important because the researchers identify them as the prisoners who were likely to have taken criminal background checks before they got their guns.
Of that group of about 520 retail buyers, around 360 - or 69% - said they bought the gun using their own name. And about 350 of the retail buyers - or 67% - said they underwent a background check using their real name. (The survey doesn’t cite reasons why they passed the check, but perhaps they didn’t have criminal records at the time).
Here’s another way of expressing the finding: About 350 of 5,200 inmates who possessed or used a gun during their crime - or 6.7% - said they went through a background check, using their real name. 
Our ruling
Van Cleave said, ""Criminals don’t go through (gun) background checks. I think it’s like 3% go through a background check.""
He was referring to results from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal inmates by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 5,200 of the prisoners said they possessed or used a firearm during their crime. Of that armed group, about 350 - or 6.7 percent - said they went through a background check to get the gun.
Van Cleave slightly understates the percentage of gun-toting criminals who went through background checks, but the gist of his claim - that very few of them did - is sound.
We rate his statement Mostly True."
14,Says that ice melting in a cup illustrates that sea levels don’t rise when icebergs melt.,"on Monday, August 12th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/12/viral-image/viral-photo-ice-melting-cup-misrepresents-icebergs/,False,Viral image,This viral photo of ice melting in a cup misrepresents icebergs and sea level rise | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Widespread, historic melting across Greenland’s ice sheet this summer has caused alarm. The Washington Post reported that Greenland has lost more than 250 billion tons of ice — enough to fill more than 90 million Olympic-size swimming pools.  
On July 31, the Post reported that the recent heat wave caused ""one of the biggest melt events ever observed on the fragile ice sheet."" 
But an image posted to Facebook that same day casts doubt on how icebergs affect sea level rise. 
The post, which had been shared more than 4,700 times by Aug. 9, shows two photos. The first photo is of a measuring cup filled with water and ice. An arrow pointing to the ice says ""ice berg"" and an arrow pointing to the water says ""ocean."" The second photo is similar except there is no ice. An arrow pointing to where the ice was says ""ice berg melts,"" an arrow pointing to the water says ""ocean"" and a third arrow pointing to the line on the measuring cup where the water stops. It’s the same line as in the first photo and the arrow says ""ocean level remains the same.""
""A little science lesson for the #IDIOTS at the global warming conference,"" the post’s author wrote.
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
That’s because the image misrepresents how icebergs affect sea level rise. 
An iceberg is a chunk of ice that broke off from a glacier, ice shelf, or a larger iceberg. They float in the ocean (or lake) and unlike sea ice that freezes and melts in the ocean, icebergs are composed of freshwater because they formed on land. 
When an iceberg melts, it doesn’t raise sea levels, said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the National Snow & Ice Data Center. But, he said, that’s because the iceberg already raised sea levels when it moved from the land into the ocean. 
A better illustration of how icebergs affect sea level, said William Colgan a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, would be to suspend an ice cube on popsicle sticks above the water. When it drops into the water or melts into the water, the water level will rise. 
""Here they’re starting with icebergs in the water,"" Colgan said. ""But the moment the iceberg crosses land into water, it’s raising sea level."" 
And if you were to then warm the water in the cup and measure it closely enough, Colgan said, the water level would rise. That’s because warm water expands; according to NASA, ""sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms."" 
Colgan likened the Facebook post to the same evidence offered by people who think the world is flat. The experiments are conducted in such a way that they support their assumptions while discounting information that contradicts them, he said. 
Our ruling
The Facebook post claims to show what happens when icebergs melt in water but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Melting ice in water — like the ice featured in the Facebook post — doesn’t cause water levels to rise. That’s because icebergs form on land and then displace water when they break off into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise. 
We rate this post False."

Conspiracy theories abound | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks,"Questions swirl around the circumstances of financier Jeffrey Epstein’s death. The New York City chief medical examiner has yet to release a final ruling on how the 66-year-old died. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said he is ""appalled"" by the ""failure to adequately secure"" Epstein.
But in the eyes of some on Facebook, Epstein is still very much alive.
""Not a chance he is dead,"" said one Facebook post that has been shared over 2,000 times. ""Very well protected. In federal custody in maximum security. In a suicide watch cell.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Whether Epstein was on a suicide watch is a major point of controversy.
But regarding whether he still lives, there are a number of people in official positions who have confirmed that Epstein is dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced his death.
The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner issued a statement Aug. 11, saying, ""Today, a medical examiner performed the autopsy of Jeffrey Epstein."" Needless to say, autopsies are only performed on the dead.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Aug. 10, ""I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. ""
One of Epstein’s lawyers Marc Fernich blamed prosecutors, the press and the Manhattan Correctional Center, where Epstein was held.
""Jailers who appear to have recklessly put Mr. Epstein in harm’s way, heedlessly placing his life at risk and failing to protect him,"" Fernich said Aug. 10.
Federal prosecutors have said their investigation of those suspected of assisting Epstein will continue despite his death.
Those details notwithstanding, the conspiracy theorists are undaunted.
Investigators are looking at many aspects of Epstein’s death, especially how closely he was monitored. Barr said Aug. 12, ""We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.""
Whatever the investigation finds, it would not change the fact that Epstein is dead. 
Our ruling
Bloggers and Facebookers are saying that Epstein is still alive.
U.S. corrections officials announced his death. The New York City medical examiner performed an autopsy. The U.S. Attorney General, federal prosecutors and an Epstein lawyer have said he is dead.
To think otherwise requires that scores of officials with direct observation of Epstein’s death are either fooled or complicit.

To make their case, Democrats cite a startling statistic.
""In 2016, counties hosting a Trump rally saw a 226% spike in hate crimes,"" reads a post on Facebook from the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. 

 
A tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., makes the same claim.
Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226% increase in hate crimes.Assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies.Your rhetoric is directly and indirectly inciting hate, Mr. President. https://t.co/axJDI3uOJU— Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) August 7, 2019 
 
A reader saw the Sanders post on social media and sent it to us, asking whether it was accurate. 
We found that the statistic comes from an academic paper. But the Sanders post makes the increase seem dramatic and causal. The findings are actually much more nuanced.  
Where the statistic comes from
The post cites the Washington Post as its source, and we tracked that down to a post on one of the newspaper’s blogs, the Monkey Cage. 
On March 22, the blog published a post titled, ""Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226% increase in hate crimes.""
The post summarized a paper written by three academics: Ayal Feinberg, an assistant professor of political science at Texas A&M University-Commerce; Regina Branton, a professor of political science at the University of North Texas; and Valerie Martinez-Ebers, a professor of political science at the University of North Texas. (Sanders’ campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)
The authors told PolitiFact that the paper is currently under peer review for publication in an academic publication. The authors presented it in 2019 at meetings of both the Southern Political Science Association and the Western Political Science Association.
Here’s how the authors summarized their work in the Post:
Using the Anti-Defamation League’s Hate, Extremism, Anti-Semitism, Terrorism map data (HEAT map), we examined whether there was a correlation between the counties that hosted one of Trump’s 275 presidential campaign rallies in 2016 and increased incidents of hate crimes in subsequent months.
To test this, we aggregated hate-crime incident data and Trump rally data to the county level and then used statistical tools to estimate a rally’s impact. We included controls for factors such as the county’s crime rates, its number of active hate groups, its minority populations, its percentage with college educations, its location in the country and the month when the rallies occurred.
We found that counties that had hosted a 2016 Trump campaign rally saw a 226% increase in reported hate crimes over comparable counties that did not host such a rally.
How the social media posts characterized the finding
In their posts, Sanders (and Omar) referenced the headline in the Monkey Cage blog post almost verbatim. But there’s a discrepancy between the headline’s phrasing and what the researchers’ academic paper looked at.
The phrasing used by Sanders implies that hate crimes spiked in one jurisdiction, jumping from one level before the rally to a rate three times higher afterward. That’s not the case. As the study summary says, the 226% difference compares Trump-rally counties to non-Trump rally counties with similar demographics.
So a more accurate phrasing might be: ""Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally had 226% more hate crimes than counties that did not.""
There are other nuances that aren’t captured by the statistic Sanders posted, experts told PolitiFact.
Challenges affecting all research of this type
In an interview, Feinberg, one of the coauthors of the study cited in the Post article, noted a few general challenges facing the field of hate-crime studies.
First, he said, there are limitations in ""how extremist incidents, events motivated by hate, and hate crimes lack a cohesive definition"" under the law. What constitutes a hate crime in one state may not in another. Also, some of the data is self-reported, making it hard to tell how many hate crimes in a given jurisdiction are unreported.
In addition, Feinberg said, ""not all police departments investigate hate crimes or perceive incidents motivated by prejudice"" with the same degree of aggressiveness. 
Feinberg said that these caveats are always top of mind for hate-crimes researchers. 
He added that a 2018 research project he collaborated on did not find that the inclusion of far-right parties in governing coalitions in Europe had an effect on reported anti-Semitic incidents. So when starting work on the Trump paper, he came in to the research with an open mind. 
Before undertaking the study, he said, ""I was not sure that Trump rhetoric would have any impact on reported extremist events, hate incidents, anti-Semitism, or hate crimes.""
Other methodological unknowns
Meanwhile, Brian Levin, Kevin Grisham, and John Reitzel, three of the contributors to a California State University-San Bernardino study of hate crime trends in recent years, told PolitiFact that it’s hard to know whether other factors could have played a role in boosting hate crimes in the counties with a Trump rally.
""It is hard to untangle all these relationships without some interviews and in-depth qualitative data,"" Grisham said. ""I think the data is fascinating and may be the first step in a larger and more in-depth project. But, we cannot say with absolute certainty that hate follows the rallies.""
For instance, Grisham said, it could be that the rallies may be a contributing cause rather than a dominant one. ""Anyone using that data should be aware of the complexity of extremist actions and their connections to rhetoric. Like anything with human beings, nothing is black and white.""
Another potential problem: A 226% difference sounds massive, but in many locales, that may mean only a small numerical difference, especially the types of low-population counties that tended to host Trump rallies. The difference between one hate crime and three is 200%, but with numbers like that, a small difference in the reporting of crimes or police investigations could cloud the question of whether Trump’s rallies had an effect.
There is ""statistical noise"" when raw numbers are small, Reitzel said. Focusing on percentage changes, ""even where the numbers are true, can still distort interpretation,"" he said.
Overall, the study is ""certainly interesting and suggestive,"" Levin said. ""But I would have preferred to see a comparison that’s apples to apples.""
Our ruling
Sanders’ post said, ""In 2016, counties hosting a Trump rally saw a 226% spike in hate crimes.""
This is from an academic study. However, it’s worth noting some caveats -- that the data can be subject to ""statistical noise"" and jurisdictional differences in hate crime definitions and police aggressiveness, and that cause and effect are hard to pinpoint.
Perhaps most important is that Sanders’ wording implies that the 226% jump stems from comparing hate crimes before and after a Trump rally within the same county, when in fact it’s a comparison from Trump rally counties to similar counties that did not host a Trump rally.
The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True."
14,"Says Joe Biden leaked the names of SEAL Team 6’s families to al-Qaida and that he ""cannot be trusted.""","on Monday, August 12th, 2019",http://politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/12/facebook-posts/no-biden-did-not-leak-names-seal-team-6-members-al/,False,Facebook posts,"No, Biden did not ‘leak’ the names of SEAL Team 6 members to al-Qaida | PolitiFact Facebook fact-checks","Osama bin Laden, infamous al-Qaida leader and 9/11 organizer, died in May 2011 after a military operation was carried out by an elite unit of U.S. Navy SEALs. 
But did then-Vice President Joe Biden really reveal the names of the members and families of the SEAL team to al-Qaida?
That’s what a viral Facebook post circulating online claims. It reads in full:
""Never forget it was Biden who leaked the names of SEAL Team 6 family’s (sic) to Al Qaeda and cannot be trusted!"" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This is not accurate. There is no evidence to suggest that Biden disclosed the names of the SEALs or their family members to the terrorist organization.
The claim appears to have originated shortly after Biden announced his 2020 bid for president in late April 2019. It appears to be rooted in a May 3 address he gave about the military operation that led to bin Laden’s death.
The operation played out in the early hours of May 2, 2011, at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 
Nine hours behind in Washington D.C., it was still May 1. President Obama confirmed that bin Laden had been killed in a televised address to the country that evening and said no Americans were harmed in the raid. In the address, Obama said ""a small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability,"" but didn’t mention the Navy SEALs.
Shortly after Obama’s announcement, multiple media outlets identified the involvement of the SEALs in the operation, but not by naming the individuals who were a part of that team.
It was after that, on May 3, that Biden gave a speech at an event for the Atlantic Council and praised the SEALs for the operation. He did not, however, say the specific unit or call out any members by name. 
""Let me briefly acknowledge tonight’s distinguished honorees,"" Biden said before praising U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis: ""Admiral Jim Stavridis is the real deal; he could tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just almost unbelievable capacity of his Navy SEALs and what they did last Sunday."" 
He later continued, ""Folks, I’d be remiss also if I didn’t say an extra word about the incredible events, extraordinary events this past Sunday. As vice president of the United States, as an American, I was in absolute awe – awe – of the capacity and dedication of the entire team, both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs; it just was extraordinary.""
Biden’s remarks were later criticized, as was the entire administration for openly crediting the SEALs, after a helicopter carrying 30 American military members, including some from Team 6, were killed on August 6, 2011, when the aircraft was shot down by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
But an investigation into the attack did not find evidence that the helicopter was targeted as part of a pre-calculated ambush. 
""We do not believe the mission was compromised,"" Garry Reid, principal deputy assistance secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict, told Congress in 2014. ""There was no external coordination so there’s no possibility of information going up the chain and somehow going out to the Taliban.""

A Facebook post claims that Joe Biden leaked the names of elite SEAL Team 6 members to al-Qaida.
There is no evidence to suggest that Biden disclosed information to the terrorist organization. Though he made remarks praising the Navy SEALs as a group in an address two days after the raid that killed bin Laden, Biden’s speech came after it was already public knowledge that the group and the CIA were part of the operation.

An Aug. 5 Facebook post even promises proof but the evidence on offer falls apart pretty quickly. 
""BOOM,"" the post begins. ""FOX REPORTER REPORTS NEXT SHOOTING 23 MINUTES BEFORE IT HAPPENED.""
A long missive follows, but the gist is this: A video clip linked in the post ""proves the deep state is doing the shootings"" because a Fox News affiliate in El Paso announced another shooting that was supposed to happen at another WalMart before it happened.
The post describes the actions of one of the TV station’s anchors and then launches into a massive conspiracy theory: ""She checks her Twitter and re-checks it, looks a little confused, and then says ‘that hasent (sic) happened yet. … Folks, this proves Twitter is in on the shootings, Fox News is in on the shootings, Wal Mart (sic) is in on the shootings ... NO WAY FOX HAD THE REPORT AHEAD OF TIME WITHOUT BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED, BUSTED BUSTED BUSTED."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
What actually happened in that news anchors were reading tweets from different time zones and were momentarily confused. 
Here's how it unfolded:
On Aug. 3, at about 12:26 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time — El Paso’s time zone — KFOX news anchors interrupted programming to report on an active shooting at a Walmart near Cielo Vista Mall in El Paso. This is the shooting that led to the deaths of at least 22 people.
Later that day, around 2:35 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time, Erika Castillo, one of the station’s anchors, said that ""an incident, as it was told to us, happened in the Walmart in Horizon (City)"" in El Paso County. 
""I’m not sure what time this tweet went out, however,"" she said, looking down at something on the desk before her. ""Okay, here it is, at 3 p.m. Well that’s, that hasn’t happened yet, so okay today is the 3rd—"" Another anchor interrupts her and says, ""This is 35 minutes ago.""
The video that was posted on Facebook cuts off around then, but the full video shows that Castillo continued: ""So this just came out. Horizon Police Department said they just responded to a subject with a gun call at the Walmart in Horizon, and they were able to locate the individual and found he was open carrying and checked out okay and then the door was reopened.""
We reached out to KFOX about the Facebook post but didn’t hear back. However, Castillo wasn’t describing a shooting that hadn’t happened yet. At 2 p.m. in both Horizon City and El Paso’s time zone of Mountain Daylight Time, the Horizon City Police Department tweeted: ""About an hour ago, HCPD responded to a subject with a gun call at our local Wal-Mart. The HCPD were able to locate the individual with and found he was open carrying and checked okay. The store has since reopened."" 
If someone read the police department’s tweet from a city in a different time zone — say, Austin, Texas, which is on Central Time — the tweet’s timestamp would read as ""3 p.m."" That’s because the Twitter timestamp changes according to the time zone of the person viewing the tweet on Twitter. 
Castillo explained in response to the video that the information she was reading from was a screen shot of a tweet that was made in a different time zone.
""I was looking at and trying to decipher an image grab of a tweet that had been made in east coast time,"" she said. ""El Paso is the only major city in Texas that sits on Mountain time. Just trying to process the timeline after a marathon of wall to wall coverage.""

Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for false rumors and conspiracy theories about the tragedy to proliferate across the internet.
As politicians commented on the shootings and mused about a potential link with violent video games, a viral Facebook post spread a fake quote attributed to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarth, R-Calif.). 
The post purports to show a recent Fox News interview in which McCarthy said there are ""no mass shootings in Japan because there are no video games there."" The post’s caption reads: ""HOW ARE REPUBLICANS EVEN REAL.""
The post, which has been shared over 6,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This is not accurate. While McCarthy did say that violent video games dehumanize players and can be a factor in mass shootings, he never mentioned that in the context of Japan. We don’t find anything close to this quote in his Aug. 4 appearance on Fox News’ show ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
At one point, McCarthy responded to a question from host Maria Bartiromo about the role video games play in violent behavior. (Read our fact-check about research disproving such a link.)
""The idea that these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others ... I’ve always felt that is a problem for future generations and others,"" McCarthy responded. ""We’ve watched from studies shown before of what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.""  

While mentioning video games, McCarthy did not mention Japan in the Bartiromo interview after the shootings.
The Facebook post’s claim came from a screenshot of a tweet that has since been deleted. 
This faux quote is Pants on Fire!"
14,"Property taxes have ""nothing to do with the state.""","on Saturday, August 10th, 2019",http://politifact.com/new-york/statements/2019/aug/10/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-claim-property-taxes-omits-mandates/,Half-True,Andrew Cuomo,Cuomo's claim on property taxes omits mandates | PolitiFact New York,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s push for a property tax cap in 2011 and his successful efforts to make it permanent have pleased fiscal watchdogs. At least one study shows that it has saved property taxpayers more than $25 billion. 
But we were skeptical about his recent claim that the state has ""nothing to do"" with property taxes. Cuomo made the remarks during an interview with a Long Island radio station. 
""Property taxes are the killer tax in the state of New York,"" Cuomo told host Jay Oliver on 103.9 FM. Cuomo said it’s been a problem since Franklin D. Roosevelt was governor, which was from 1929 to 1932. ""It has nothing to do with the state. I may be a little defensive for a second because it's early and I'm a little defensive. FDR used to rail about the property tax. Because people think the state has something to do with the property tax and they used to complain about high taxes and FDR got very defensive and he said, 'I've got nothing to do with the property taxes, it's all local taxes and school taxes,' which is true. So I don’t control the property tax.""
Cuomo has invoked Roosevelt’s thoughts on property taxes during several speeches, and on this topic, the two governors sound a similar note. In his 1932 annual message to the state legislature, Roosevelt talked about complaints from the public about property taxes: ""After three long years during which I have tried in every part of the State to make people understand that real estate taxes have absolutely nothing to do with State Government, the public is at last coming to realize that the increase in real estate taxes is due wholly to the increase in the cost of local and not State Government."" 
Property taxes are collected by local governments and school districts as a way to pay for local programs, and local officials have control over big budget items such as contracts that set employee salaries. But that’s not all property taxes fund. Federal and state governments also mandate some programs, meaning they require school districts and counties to do certain things, but in some cases do not provide the financial support for these programs to be carried out. 
A 2017 Cornell University survey of local governments, done in partnership with local government advocacy groups, found that the primary sources of fiscal stress for these governments came from state influence on their finances and service delivery. According to the Cornell survey, ""the top three contributors to fiscal stress that local governments identified were stagnant state aid, state mandates, and the property tax cap."" Cornell researchers cited another study, which found that New York state ""decentralizes more expenditure and service responsibility onto local governments than any other state, except Nevada."" 
These underfunded or unfunded mandates, as they are known, are a topic of such concern for local governments and school districts that every year, local officials lobby the governor and state lawmakers for relief. 
Medicaid is perhaps the most talked-about underfunded mandate in New York state. Though the state manages the Medicaid program, it shifts part of the cost of the program onto counties. The New York Association of Counties, which advocates on behalf of counties, calculates that in New York, counties spend more on state Medicaid costs than other counties across the country combined, not including voluntary payments counties make to support their public hospitals and nursing homes. 
In 2015, the state capped the local Medicaid share, saving local governments more than $3 billion per year. ""Even with the freeze, Medicaid remains one of the largest expenses faced by local governments in New York—and one they have little or no means to control,"" wrote Bill Hammond, director of health policy at the Empire Center for Public Policy, which is fiscally conservative. 
""New York’s local share is still an aberration nationally;"" the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission wrote in 2018. ""New York requires more local contributions to finance Medicaid services than all other states in the nation combined.""
In addition to Medicaid, counties must share the cost of programs such as child welfare, indigent criminal defense, probation and preschool special education. In January, the New York Association of Counties estimated that up to 80 percent of a county’s total budget can be used to pay for state and federal mandates.  
Cuomo’s record
When we approached Cuomo’s press office about the governor’s claim, staff there connected us with Jim Malatras, a former director of state operations in the Cuomo administration who is now the president of Empire State College, part of the State University of New York. Malatras worked on the property tax cap as a member of the administration and studied the effects of the cap as president of the Rockefeller Institute of Government. 
The governor ""does not, by law, get to set what the property tax is,"" Malatras said.  
Cuomo has helped property taxpayers by being ""very aggressive"" in managing local costs, Malatras said. He pointed to the establishment of a less generous pension tier, capping of the local share of Medicaid, and the property tax cap. The STAR program, which began under a previous governor, provides state funds to offset local school taxes. He also said that local governments and school districts have other sources of revenue in addition to property taxes. 
""The state doesn’t have anything to do with property tax levies,"" Malatras said. Local governments engage in many activities that they have complete control over, such as economic development programs, and the wages they pay their employees, he said. Some mandates that local governments complain about are in the state constitution, or were established by the U.S. Supreme Court. Local government officials also complain about labor rules, but the state has to follow those rules too, Malatras said. As for complaints that the cap limits governments’ flexibility, as noted in the Cornell study, Malatras said that with enough support from governing bodies or voters, local governments and school districts can override the cap. 
In the past, the Cuomo administration has acknowledged the financial burden the state places on local governments and has taken steps to address it. Earlier this year, Cuomo took credit for reducing property taxes.  
Cuomo started a Mandate Relief Council, and in January 2012, Cuomo’s office announced the council’s first meeting, and described why it was necessary: ""The State depends on its local governments and school districts to deliver essential services to its residents and often prescribes how these services should be provided. These requirements are woven throughout State laws and regulations limiting flexibility and increasing costs. The Council was created to find, review, and reform these mandates."" 
According to the ""local government"" section of Cuomo’s 2020 executive budget briefing book, the budget ""continues Governor Cuomo’s commitment and track record of reducing property taxes.""
Our ruling
Cuomo said the state has ""nothing to do"" with property taxes. It is true that local governments and school districts set property tax rates and collect property taxes. But when local officials set the amount that must be raised from property taxes, they must collect enough money to cover the cost of programs the state and federal governments have said they must provide, even in cases, like Medicaid, when they do not have control over the program’s administration. Local governments have other ways to raise revenue, but the property tax is one of their primary sources.

14,"Says Donald Trump ""asserted that immigrants would quote, ‘carve you up with a knife’.""","on Friday, August 9th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/09/joe-biden/joe-biden-takes-donald-trumps-words-about-gang-mem/,False,Joe Biden,Joe Biden takes Donald Trump’s words about gang members out of contex,"At a campaign stop in Iowa, former Vice President Joe Biden laid into President Donald Trump for stirring up the worst in Americans.
Presidents ""can encourage us to appeal to our better angels, our better nature,"" Biden said Aug. 7. ""They can also unleash the deepest, darkest forces in the nation. That is what I believe Donald Trump has chosen to do.""
""Days before the midterm,"" Biden continued, ""He fomented fears of a caravan headed to the United States and created hysteria when he said, ‘Look, look at what's marching up. This is an invasion.’ He asserted that immigrants would quote, ‘carve you up with a knife’."" 
Trump regularly speaks of an invasion. He has mentioned it at many rallies, including one in Michigan in March and another in Florida in May. He said then, ""When you see these caravans, starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion."" He has used the word in seven tweets since July 2015 to refer to immigrants more broadly, according to Factba.se.
But this fact-check focuses on whether Trump warned that immigrants will ""carve you up with a knife.""
He did not.
At an October 2018 rally in Texas, Trump attacked then-U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, who is now running for U.S. president.
""O'Rourke voted against the border wall,"" Trump said. ""He voted against Kate's law. And he voted for Obama amnesty. O'Rourke even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation. He doesn't want to deport them. He says they're people. They're people. They carve you up with a knife, but they're people.""
MS-13 is a violent transnational gang with members primarily in Central America and the United States. Trump’s words were clearly aimed at gang members, not all immigrants.
For the record, O’Rourke did not vote to shield MS-13 members from deportation. PolitiFact Texas dug into a U.S. House dispute over a bill that would give U.S. officials more leeway in defining gangs. Democrats argued that officials already had the authority to deport anyone suspected of gang involvement.
The Biden campaign did not respond in time for publication.
Our ruling
Biden said that Trump ""asserted that immigrants would quote, ‘carve you up with a knife’.""
Trump was talking about MS-13 gang members.

14,"""The Trump Administration cut funding allocated to the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationalism.""","on Friday, August 9th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/09/pete-buttigieg/fact-checking-whether-trump-cut-money-combat-white/,Half-True,Pete Buttigieg,-checking whether Trump cut money to combat white nationalism,"Democrats after the El Paso shooting renewed their criticism that the Trump administration hasn’t done enough about the threat of white nationalism.
""The Trump administration cut funding allocated to the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationalism,"" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg wrote Aug. 5 in a Medium post. ""We must do more than simply reinstate that funding — we must dedicate $1 billion to ensure that law enforcement across all agencies and all levels have sufficient resources to counter the growing tide of white nationalist violence.""
Buttigieg was referring to an Obama era grant program called Countering Violent Extremism. One group founded by former white supremacists and neo-Nazis, Life After Hate, was slated to receive money under the grant but the offer was rescinded under Trump, Buttigieg said. 
But there is more to the broader story than what Buttigieg described.
""The picture is more nuanced than, ‘The Obama administration was going after white supremacists and the Trump administration stopped it,’"" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, previously told PolitiFact. ""Neither went after white supremacists.""
We previously rated a similar claim by Sen. Cory Booker Mostly False. Buttigieg’s wording isn’t as problematic as was Booker's, which referenced the wrong department and used stronger language, but it is still imprecise.
Trump’s actions on Countering Violent Extremism grant
The Countering Violent Extremism program was launched during the Obama administration to work with local leaders to deter U.S. residents from joining violent extremist groups.
In the final days of Obama’s tenure, the Homeland Security department announced 31 groups would be awarded a total of $10 million in grants. 
Once Trump took office, his administration froze the grants. Then, in June 2017, Homeland Security released a list of 26 grant recipients.
Some of the awardees named under Obama had dropped out, citing fears of anti-Muslim bias under Trump. 
But Buttigieg’s campaign zeroed in on one group whose $400,000 grant was rescinded: Life After Hate. (Read about another rescinded grant to the University of North Carolina that we covered in a different fact-check. UNC’s application said it would target extremist messaging including by jihadists but it also mentioned that it had expertise in white supremacists.)
In its application, Life After Hate didn’t single out white nationalists — though the group works to help people who want to leave racism or violent extremism behind. 
The application stated the group would work with others to engage online with ""supporters and sympathizers of far-right extremism and jihadism."" Far-right extremism isn’t the same as white nationalism, although some people use the terms interchangeably.
""We used the term ‘violent far-right extremism,’ which would include the more euphemistic ‘white nationalism,’"" Life After Hate’s spokesman told us.
Here’s what we know about why their application was rescinded under Trump.
Homeland Security spokespersons said applicants were rejected because they didn’t meet new criteria like working with law enforcement — not because of their interest in combating white supremacy. 
Trump faced criticism that the grant program was too focused on Muslims. (Nearly all of the accepted projects were centered around working with Muslims or immigrants.) But the Obama administration faced the same critique, including from the liberal Brennan Center.
Assessing the ""cut""
Buttigieg said the Trump administration ""cut"" funding for Countering Violent Extremism, but there’s more to that, too. It was a two-year grant program that expired in July 2019. The administration did not seek to renew it.
Brian Jackson, a researcher at the RAND Corporation who co-wrote a 2019 report for Homeland Security on terrorism prevention, said reupping the grant program would require action by both the administration and Congress.
In a House committee hearing on white supremacy in June, a homeland security assistant secretary seemed to leave open the door to potential future funding. 
""We are evaluating and assessing future requests for funding associated with that,"" said the DHS official, Elizabeth Neumann, about Countering Violent Extremism grants.
The Buttigieg campaign cited articles about reductions in staff and funding in the office that housed Countering Violent Extremism compared to the Obama administration.
The program was located within the Office of Community Partnerships in the Obama administration. That office is now the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention, which aims to address all forms of domestic and international terrorism. 
George Selim, the former director of the Office for Community Partnerships, has said his office once had a budget of $21 million and 16 staff. Selim, who now works for the Anti-Defamation League, said the office has since been cut to a nearly $3 million budget based off a DHS 2020 budget justification document. Congress has not yet finished appropriations bills for 2020, so we don’t yet know what the office’s budget will be.
Finally, the Buttigieg campaign also pointed to an April article in the Daily Beast that reported that the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts who were focused on domestic terrorism. A DHS official told the Daily Beast that the same people were working on the same issues as part of a restructuring.
The Trump administration defended its strategy on terrorism, as released in October 2018. It states that the country faces threats from domestic terrorists motivated by various ideologies including ""racially motivated extremism."" 
Our ruling
Buttigieg said, ""The Trump Administration cut funding allocated to the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationalism.""
He points to the $10 million Countering Violent Extremism grant program, which was launched under Obama and not renewed under President Trump. It was meant to last for two years. When it expired in July 2019, Trump did not renew it. That’s not exactly the same as a ""cut.""
However, a group that was slated to get a grant under Obama, Life After Hate, had its grant rescinded under the Trump administration while the program was going on. The group was one of the only ones with expertise on white nationalism. Overall, most of the grant proposals were focused on Muslims or immigrants, and not white nationalists. 
Buttigieg left out part of the story.

Bernie Sanders took the debate stage last month. 
""So Bernie and Hillary want to make the cut off date for abortions up to 36 weeks,"" the 2016 post says. ""That’s right! They say a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life. If anyone was wondering what a baby looks like at 36 weeks, here’s a picture of my baby boy born at 36 weeks. Share this post, get the word out!""
This post, which has been shared more than 20,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We’re going to focus on Sanders for this check since he is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, not former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. But Snopes looked into this claim in 2016 when Clinton was running for president and determined it was false for both Democrats.  As it is still being shared three years later in virtually identical language, we went looking for evidence to substantiate the claim, but we found none.
We emailed Sanders’ campaign to ask about the Facebook post but did not hear back. 
Sanders doesn’t mention abortion limits on his campaign website. Listed among his ""issues"" is the ""fight for women’s rights,"" and there he makes two points about abortion: 
""Fully fund Planned Parenthood, Title X, and other initiatives that protect women’s health, access to contraception, and the availability of a safe and legal abortion."" 
""Oppose all efforts to undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade, and appoint federal judges who will uphold women’s most fundamental rights.""
He echoed the latter position during the first Democratic presidential debate in June. As a senator, he has framed abortion as health care. And he’s supported abortions since before the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. In 1972, the Bennington Banner newspaper reported that Sanders, then the Vermont candidate for governor, said the abortion issue should only be of concern between a woman and her doctor, not the government.
More recently, he has criticized states that have restricted abortion but, BuzzFeed reported in May, he ""did not delve into more specifics about what he would do to fight the laws if elected.""
""The consequences will be absolutely disastrous and threaten the very lives of women,"" BuzzFeed quoted him as saying on the campaign trail. ""It is not an exaggeration to say that banning legal, medically assisted abortion — and forcing women back into the arms of quacks — will quite literally kill women.""   
In 2018, Sanders voted against a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks and in 2016, PBS NewsHour reported in February, he wouldn’t give a specific answer when asked whether he would place any limits on abortions but ""repeatedly said he was ‘very strongly pro-choice’ and believed the decision was between a woman and her doctor."" 
It came up that year when, during a Fox News town hall as Sanders and Clinton vied for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bret Baier asked Sanders if he could ""name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be okay with abortion being illegal.""
""It’s not a question of me being okay,"" Sanders said. ""I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body.""
Baier said: ""I guess the genesis of the question is that there are some Democrats who say after five months, with the exception of the life of the mother or the health of the baby, that perhaps that’s something to look at. You’re saying no.""
Sanders said: ""I am very strongly pro-choice. That is a decision to be made by the woman, her physician, and her family. That’s my view.""
Now, Sanders among other Democratic presidential candidates have cosponsored a bill that would codify Roe vs. Wade. New York did this in January when it enacted the Reproductive Health Act, a law that permits abortions within 24 weeks or later if the fetus isn’t viable or the mother’s health or life are threatened.  
""As president, he would use every available executive, judicial, and legislative tool to (protect the constitutional rights of women),"" a campaign spokesman for Sanders told BuzzFeed in a statement in May, ""including by appointing federal judges who will protect Roe, by fighting unconstitutional bans and restrictions, and by building a movement that speaks out for the vast majority of Americans who believe Roe should remain law of the land.""
When asked during a Fox News town hall in April whether a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy up to the moment of birth, he said he thinks that happens ""very rarely"" and struck a familiar note: ""the decision over abortion belongs to a woman and her physician."" 
Searching for ""Bernie Sanders"" and ""36 weeks"" and ""abortion"" in the Nexis news archive, we found one result: a May 2019 story in the Toronto Star about Rich Coleman, a member of Canada’s legislative assembly. The article discusses Coleman’s comments on abortion at a March for Life rally. 
""It wasn’t Coleman’s first March for Life rally nor his first public foray into women’s reproductive health,"" the story says. ""On his Facebook account last August, Coleman shared a post — viewed by the Star Vancouver before he deleted it several days later — falsely alleging that former U.S. Democrat leadership candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wanted to allow abortions up to 36 weeks (8.5 months) of pregnancy because they believe fetuses have ‘no rights to life.’ On Aug. 31, he removed it admitting it was an ‘anti-abortion fake news story.’""
Our ruling
The Facebook post said Bernie Sanders wants ""to make the cut off date for abortions up to 36 weeks"" because he says ""a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life.""  
The record shows that while Sanders has refused to support specific abortion restrictions, he has not called to extend the cut off date for abortions to 36 weeks because ""a baby at that point feels no pain and has no rights to life."" 
For nearly five decades, when asked about specific abortion policy, Sanders has repeatedly stated in response that the decision to abort should be between a woman and her doctor, not the government.

Trump was referring to a news conference by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. Did they misrepresent what happened? For this fact-check, we go to the tape.
Trump’s visit
Trump went straight from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to the hospital where he spent about two hours. No media was allowed. The White House provided video and photos. They show many smiles and handshakes as Trump met with people.
We love you Dayton, Ohio! pic.twitter.com/IaCZAdyuzL— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019 
Afterward, the hospital’s CEO told reporters the visit was meaningful and at times emotional.
A City Hall press conference
Controversy preceded Trump’s visit. At a vigil after the shooting that killed nine people, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was shouted down by the crowd. The day before Trump came to Dayton, Mayor Whaley told reporters she was disappointed in Trump’s response to the shooting and wouldn’t discourage protestors who objected to his visit.
Whaley and Brown greeted Trump at the Air Force base and accompanied him at the hospital.
After he left, they took questions at Dayton City Hall. They spent the bulk of their time talking about gun policy. They said they asked Trump to support universal background checks, fund Medicaid mental health services and ban assault weapons.
Brown downplayed the value of Trump giving awards to the police who stopped the killer. Brown suggested what he cast as a more substantive step.
""The most important thing you can do for these police officers is take these assault weapons off the streets so they don't have to go up against those assault weapons, and they need to take down a shooter,"" Brown said.
Brown criticized Trump for using rhetoric that he said divides Americans and invites racial discord. And both of them said they expected little action to come from Trump to regulate firearms.
Brown and Whaley said very little about Trump’s time with patients and others.
By our count, they spoke about 1,800 words in the 14 minutes they spent with reporters. Out of that, they offered about 60 words describing the time Trump spent with citizens.
Those words did not run afoul of Trump’s version of events.
""I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the United States came today,"" Whaley said.
""He was received as well as you can expect by the patients,"" Brown said. ""They are hurting. He was comforting, he and Melania did the right things. It's his job, in part, to comfort people. I'm glad he did it.""
Viewers of the video can judge the tone of their remarks.
Immediately after the news conference, the Associated Press reported, ""Ohio Democratic officials say they were gratified by President Donald Trump’s visit to the Dayton, the scene of a weekend mass shooting, and said Trump was treated respectfully, despite the fact some didn’t agree with his past rhetoric or policies.""
The White House declined to comment.
Our ruling
Trump said the remarks from Democrats Brown and Whaley misrepresented his visit with survivors, medical staff and first responders of the shooting in Dayton. He called their presentation ""a fraud.""
Brown and Whaley said very little about Trump’s meeting, but what they said leaned toward the positive. Brown called Trump ""comforting,"" and said he was glad Trump had come. Whaley said people were grateful that the president had visited.
That might amount only to measured praise of Trump’s time at the hospital, but it doesn’t come close to being a fraud or misrepresenting the mood.

14,"Says President Donald Trump is ""talking about exterminating Latinos.""","on Thursday, August 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/aug/08/nicolle-wallace/no-trump-hasnt-talked-about-exterminating-latinos/,Pants on Fire!,Nicolle Wallace,Donald Trump didn't talk about exterminating Latinos | Pund,"Several Democratic presidential candidates have declared a link between President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants and the recent mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.
But while Trump has spoken often of an ""invasion"" at the border, he has not been ""talking about exterminating Latinos,"" as MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace falsely claimed Aug. 5.
Wallace was responding to a remark from guest and columnist Raul Reyes, who said Trump’s use of the words ""invasion"" and ""infestation"" could make some people wish for an extermination. ""With an infestation, the natural conclusion is to attempt an extermination,"" Reyes said.
As a point of comparison, Wallace noted how President George W. Bush (for whom she served as communications director) catered to Latino voters and President Barack Obama tried to take on immigration reform with input from Latino leaders. 
""You now have a president, as you said, talking about exterminating Latinos,"" she continued.
The next day, Wallace apologized for the remark on Twitter, saying she ""misspoke."" (MSNBC declined to comment.) 
I misspoke about Trump calling for an extermination of Latinos. My mistake was unintentional and I’m sorry. Trump’s constant assault on people of color and his use of the word “invasion” to describe the flow of immigrants is intentional and constant.— Nicolle Wallace (@NicolleDWallace) August 7, 2019 
But Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, told us ""many more will hear what she said on air than her apology.""
Here’s the bottom line: Trump has frequently charged immigrants with invading the United States, but he’s never spoken of ""exterminating Latinos.""
What Trump hasn’t said
Trump has never used any version of the word ""exterminate"" to describe Latinos, Hispanics or immigrants in or en route to the United States. 
We checked Google and Nexis and found no examples. A search of the president’s Twitter account also turned up no results. 
We also looked at the interactive transcript website Factba.se, which tracks Trump’s public statements and tweets. According to Factba.se’s database, Trump has only ever mentioned extermination in reference to the Holocaust or ISIS’s attacks on Christians or Americans.
What Trump has said
While Trump hasn’t called for ""exterminating Latinos,"" he has made frequent use of the words ""invasion"" and ""infestation"" to decry the flow of immigrants across the southern border. 
A CNN montage shows several times dating back to November when Trump has referred to an invasion at the border in public statements.
During a May rally in Panama City, Fla., Trump lamented, ""How do you stop these people? You can’t."" When a rallygoer shouted, ""Shoot them,"" Trump pointed to the crowd, shook his head, chuckled and said, ""That’s only in the Panhandle can you get away with that statement.""

Trump has also used the word ""invade"" or a variant of it in at least 10 tweets since the launch of his 2016 presidential campaign. Plus, his campaign has posted more than 2,000 ads on Facebook since January that include the word ""invasion,"" according to the New York Times. 
We’ve fact-checked a few of Trump’s invasion-related claims.
Similarly, Trump has used variations of the word ""infest"" in at least eight tweets dating back to the start of his 2016 campaign, usually in reference to an alleged gang presence he’s said is plaguing sanctuary cities where undocumented immigrants cannot be prosecuted or deported. 
More examples of the president talking about an invasion or an infestation can be found on Factba.se.
Trump also came under critics’ fire for using the word ""animals"" when talking about immigrants and MS-13 gang members, and for saying, in reference to the 2017 violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, ""you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.""
Democrats on the campaign trail and other critics of the president have said his rhetoric is echoed in an online post possibly linked to the El Paso shooter. According to the Washington Post, the manifesto sounds alarm about a so-called Hispanic invasion but says the shooter’s beliefs predated anything Trump has said.
Our ruling
Wallace said Trump is ""talking about exterminating Latinos.""
Trump has frequently labeled the flow of immigrants an ""invasion"" and railed against ""infested"" areas of the country. But he hasn’t said anything about ""exterminating Latinos.""
The context of the interview was about words and their meanings. If Wallace wanted to hold Trump accountable for what he’s said, then we have an obligation to do the same for her.

14,"Says Royce West stood with Wendy Davis ""to support painful late-term abortions.""","on Thursday, August 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/aug/08/john-cornyn/fact-checking-john-cornyns-ad-royce-west-and-abort/,Half-True,John Cornyn,-checking John Cornyn's ad on Royce West and abortion | PolitiFact Texas,"U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, released the first attack advertisement of his reelection campaign in July, targeting one of his potential Democratic opponents: state Sen. Royce West of Dallas.
West is one of several Democrats who have announced their candidacies for Cornyn’s seat. MJ Hegar, an Air Force veteran from Round Rock, and Amanda Edwards, a Houston City Council member, also are running.
In Cornyn’s commercial, titled ""Their Side,"" a narrator describes West’s position on several issues, including abortion.
""Who is Royce West?"" the narrator says. ""West is a liberal politician who stood with Wendy Davis to support painful late-term abortions.""
There’s no question that West supported former-state Sen. Wendy Davis in her filibuster of a bill restricting abortion during the 2013 legislative session. Cornyn’s campaign pointed us to the record vote on the legislation and to questions and comments West made to media outlets about the filibuster.
But there’s more to this claim than meets the eye.
The legislation in question was about broader issues than the cutoff for legal abortions. In addition to banning abortions from occurring past 20 weeks post-fertilization, the bill proposed strict restrictions on facilities that offered abortion services that many Democratic lawmakers worried would force clinics across the state to close.
Let’s start at the beginning.
Davis filibuster relied on other Democratic support
On the last day of a specially called legislative session in 2013, Davis rose to speak at 11:18 a.m. and announced her intention to filibuster an abortion-related bill being promoted by Republican lawmakers in the chamber. The chamber needed to vote on the bill before a midnight deadline.
The legislation banned abortion procedures after 20 weeks of pregnancy and instituted a series of requirements for physicians and clinics where the procedure was performed. It required abortion clinics to meet the same hospital-like standards that exist for ambulatory surgical centers and required doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of an abortion clinic.
Opponents of the bill, including Davis, said the legislation could prompt most of the state’s more than 40 abortion clinics to close their doors.
Davis spoke for more than 11 hours on the bill, becoming a political celebrity in the process.
Republican lawmakers raised points of order, accusing Davis of violating state law in her attempt to talk the bill to death, and caused members of the public who had gathered in the gallery to watch the proceedings to erupt into shouts, sending the chamber into chaos.
Democratic lawmakers raised procedural questions to run out the clock as leaders in the chamber attempted to administer a vote on the bill.
Video footage from the chamber and from different news outlets shows West involved in many private conversations with Senate leadership and other Democrats over the course of the filibuster. When the clock struck midnight, West asked the lieutenant governor to adjourn the session before voting on the bill. 
""What time does the session end? Midnight"" West said from the floor. ""We can’t take a vote after midnight — there’s no session.""
A Texas Observer account of the evening includes a photo of West captioned: ""In a hurried vote on SB 5, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst checks his watch while Sen. Royce West waves his cell phone to show it’s past midnight.""
The bill was not passed during the first special session, but then-Gov. Rick Perry immediately called another special session and the bill was refiled — called House Bill 2 — and adopted. West voted against the legislation.
West told the Associated Press that, while Democrats did not have enough votes to kill the bill in the chamber, they would pursue legal action.
""We do not have the numbers to stop it,"" West said. ""As soon as it’s signed by the governor, it will be challenged … we believe the whole bill is unconstitutional.""
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the bill’s restrictions on clinics placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. By that time, just 19 abortion clinics in the state were still operational.
The ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks was not affected by the ruling and is still in place.
What is a late-term abortion?
Cornyn’s advertisement discusses West’s stance on abortion, in particular his alleged support of ""painful late-term abortions."" But there are a few problems with that characterization.
Cornyn’s campaign pointed to a Washington Post article that stated: ""‘Late-term’ abortions are generally understood to take place during or after the 21st to 24th week of gestation, which is late in the second trimester.""
The article went on to say that there is no precise medical or legal definition for the phrase, a point echoed by Kate Connors, a spokeswoman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in an email.
Connors pointed to a fact sheet from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that states abortions that occur after 21-weeks post-fertilization account for slightly more than 1 percent of all abortions that take place in the United States.
They said many of these procedures occur when a fetus is found to have anomalies ""incompatible with life,"" where ""death is likely before or shortly after birth."" 
Connors pointed to a different fact-sheet exploring the potential for a fetus to experience pain. 
""A human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until after viability,"" the sheet reads. ""Rigorous scientific studies have found that the connections necessary to transmit signals from peripheral sensory nerves to the brain, as well as the brain structures necessary to process those signals, do not develop until at least 24 weeks of gestation.""
In its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, the U.S. Supreme Court held that states could enact restrictions on abortion procedures after ""fetal viability"" — anywhere from 24 to 28 weeks post-fertilization.
Do Davis and West support late-term abortions? 
Davis went on to run for governor in 2014 (she lost to Republican Greg Abbott), and throughout her campaign she faced questions about her filibuster and inaccurate characterizations of her stance on abortion.
In October of 2013, Texas Right to Life aired a radio advertisement that said ""Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion."" We rated that claim False.
Bo Delp, the spokesman for her campaign at the time, told PolitiFact that Davis ""opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered.""
This supports a comment that Matt Angle, an adviser to Davis, made to the American-Statesman around the same time.
He said her filibuster was not ""about the 20-week ban"" included in the legislation.
""She was thrust into a fight over whether or not Texas women would have access to health care or not, and the leadership in the Senate insisted upon adding to that severe restrictions to basic health care,"" Angle said. ""She’s against late-term abortion except in cases of rape, incest, the life and health of the mother or when there are profound and serious non-reversible problems with the fetus.""
West’s campaign did not return return multiple requests for comment over a two-week period about his stance on ""late-term abortion"" and his role in Davis’ filibuster.
Our Ruling
An advertisement from Cornyn’s campaign said that West, one of his Democratic challengers, stood with Wendy Davis ""to support painful late-term abortions.""
It’s true that West supported Davis in her effort to kill a bill that would ban abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization, but the legislation did much more than that. Opponents worried that it would close abortion clinics, which offer other health care services to women.
Davis has said she opposes late-term abortions and officials with her team said she filibustered the legislation because it would force clinics to close — which it did.

14,"Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""","on Thursday, August 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-done-more-other-presidents-s/,Half-True,Donald Trump,Donald Trump says he's done more than other presidents to solve the gun problem. Has he?,"As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump accepted the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and released a Facebook video headlined by the remark, ""I won’t let them take away our guns!!""
Now, as president, he wants to be seen as a problem-solver on gun policy.
At a media availability on Aug. 4 following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, a reporter asked President Donald Trump, ""The gun problem – what are you going to do about it? How are you going to address it?""
Trump responded, ""We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it’s ... really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done.""
We wondered whether it’s accurate that Trump and his administration have ""done much more than most administrations"" to curb gun violence.
We found that Trump has made two concrete moves that tightened gun policy and has taken additional actions on other aspects of curbing mass shootings. This is more than some of his predecessors have done. However, this tells only part of the story, because Trump and his administration have simultaneously advanced more policies that would expand gun rights or prevent efforts to limit gun rights.
Limits on gun rights
Trump has clearly acted to limit gun rights in two cases.
• Using regulatory powers to bypass Congress, Trump in 2018 acted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one. This technique was used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured almost 900 attending a music festival in Las Vegas in 2017.
• Trump signed a large federal spending bill that included language to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. The legislation had received bipartisan support in Congress.
In addition, under Trump, the federal government has increased prosecutions of firearms offenses. (See our fact-check.)
The Trump campaign said he deserves credit for actions beyond the scope of guns specifically. They cited his signing of the STOP School Violence Act, which authorizes more than $1 billion in grant funding through 2028 to support violence-prevention programs in schools. The campaign also pointed to Trump’s establishment of the Federal Commission on School Safety. (The commission released a final report in December 2018.)
Expansions of gun rights and opposition to tightening gun rules
Still, the Trump administration’s gun-specific efforts have tended to focus on expanding gun rights or opposing tighter limits on them. Some examples:
• He signed legislation to overturn a rule enacted under President Barack Obama that made it harder for some mentally ill people to obtain guns. (Advocates for disabled Americans and civil-liberties groups joined with gun advocates in supporting Trump’s action.)
• Trump in 2019 threatened to veto bills passed by the House to require federal background checks for all gun sales. (A veto has not been necessary since the measures remain stalled in the Senate.)
• Trump’s Interior Department reversed a ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks and other federal lands.
• Trump’s Interior Department formally proposed a rule to expand hunting on federal lands.
• Trump’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives delayed an Obama-era rule to make gun-safety devices more readily available where firearms are sold.
• Trump’s Justice Department formally sided with plaintiffs seeking to overturn New York City restrictions on transporting handguns at the Supreme Court.
So, for Trump to focus solely on his efforts to limit gun rights ignores the more numerous examples in which he has sought to expand gun rights or prevent restrictions of gun rights.
""The Trump administration has been mostly missing in action on enhanced gun control,"" said Harold (Jay) Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida.
How Trump’s efforts to restrict gun rights compare to previous presidents
The universe of comparable presidents is actually pretty small. In the past 50 years, only two presidents — Bill Clinton and Obama, both Democrats — made tightening gun policies a significant item on their policy agendas. 
In 1993, Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which heightened requirements for background checks, and the following year, he signed the assault weapons ban, which sunsetted after 10 years in 2004. 
Obama, for his part, pursued gun control policies, especially after the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. But facing a Republican-controlled Congress opposed to gun control, such efforts went nowhere.
Instead, between 2013 and 2016, Obama undertook executive actions on mental health treatment, strengthened background checks, restarting federal gun research that had been frozen for years, funding additional federal agents, tracing guns found during investigations to determine trafficking patterns, and guiding U.S. attorneys to go after felons looking to buy guns or people lying in order to pass background checks.
""Trump has not had a pro-control record, although most previous presidents have not done much more"" than he has, said Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck.
However, experts caution against a direct comparison between Obama’s record and Trump’s.
""During Obama's administration, there were at least four bills to close the ‘gun show loophole,’ two attempts to renew the assault weapons ban, two attempts to ban high-capacity magazines, two to ban ‘build them yourself’ assault rifle kits, and one to ban imported assault weapons,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""Every single one of these 11 bills died on the floor of either the House or Senate, so it was never an option for Obama to sign them into law.""
Given that Republicans — the more consistently pro-gun party — have controlled either the presidency or at least one chamber of Congress for most of the past quarter-century, ""it’s not really surprising that more restrictions have not been passed at the federal level,"" Schildkraut said.
Our ruling
Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" Trump said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""
Trump has banned bump stocks, supported a bipartisan effort to improve the background-check database, and prioritized gun-related prosecutions. This number does compare favorably to what some other recent presidents have accomplished.
At the same time, Trump’s comment ignores that his administration has pursued multiple efforts to expand gun laws and regulations or to block efforts to tighten them.

That’s Pants on Fire. | PolitiFact Californ","The California Republican Party made a misleading and blatantly inaccurate claim this week that President Donald Trump was ""kicked off the California ballot"" during a fundraising pitch on its website.
It asks supporters to donate to get Trump ""back on the ballot."" 
The message goes on to claim ""Governor Newsom signed SB27, preventing President Trump from appearing on next year’s ballot. The law is clearly unconstitutional and disenfranchises millions of California voters. We need your support to overturn SB27.""
We set out on a fact check. 
Our research 
Gov. Gavin Newsom did sign Senate Bill 27 into law last week. But it doesn’t prevent Trump or anyone else from appearing on the California ballot, nor does it mean he’s ""kicked off."" 
Instead, it requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state’s primary. The requirement does not extend to the general election.
Here’s what the law says: 
""This bill would enact the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, which would require a candidate for President, in order to have the candidate’s name placed upon a primary election ballot, to file the candidate’s income tax returns for the 5 most recent taxable years with the Secretary of State, as specified.""
Trump has refused to release his returns, saying since his campaign for president they are under audit. 
Trump, the Republican National Committee and California Republican Party have all filed lawsuits over SB 27, arguing it is unconstitutional and ""a naked political attack"" on Trump. The law passed on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
Some legal analysts have questioned it, as did former Gov. Jerry Brown when he vetoed a similar law two years ago, saying it would create a slippery slope of trying to force candidates to release additional information to run for president. 
The courts will eventually decide on its constitutionality. But as it stands, it does not prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot. 
Asked about the accuracy of the claim, a spokesperson for the California Republican Party pointed to a news release on the party’s website about the lawsuits. The release criticizes the law and contends Democrats are using it ""to keep Republicans home"" during the next election. 
But it doesn’t provide any information showing Trump was kicked off the ballot or prevented from being on it. California is still several months from finalizing its ballot for the March 2020 primary. 
After we asked about the claim, the headline on the party’s website changed slightly from President Trump ""kicked off"" the ballot to President Trump ""off"" the ballot. 
Another line changed from asking donors to contribute to get Trump ""back on the ballot"" to get him ""on the ballot.""
Our ruling
The California Republican Party recently claimed President Trump was ""kicked off the California ballot"" as a result of Senate Bill 27. 
The recently signed law requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state’s primary. It does not apply to candidates in the general election.
Republicans are challenging the law in court, saying it’s unconstitutional. 
The law very well may be struck down by a court. But, as written, it does not kick Trump off the ballot or prevent him from being on it. That ballot is still several months from being finalized. 
It might be a difficult decision for Trump to release his tax returns, which he has refused to do, but it still provides this avenue for him and all future candidates for president and governor to appear on the primary ballot. 
The message on the state party’s website is blatantly false, ignores any mention of what’s actually in the law and how candidates can comply. What’s more, the false message is being used as a fundraiser. 
For these reasons, we rate it Pants on Fire.

14,"""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military. We're talking about 5 to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.""","on Thursday, August 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/08/bernie-sanders/do-private-citizens-have-5-10-million-assault-weap/,Half-True,Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders says private citizens have up to 10 million assault weapons, more than US military","The United States doesn’t require gun registration.
So, when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., claims private citizens have more assault weapons than members of the military do, how does he know?
""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military,"" the 2020 presidential candidate said in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.""
Sanders’ claim suffers a bit from comparing private and military weapons, which are different. Plus, he has to rely on wildly varying estimates, although his seems on the lower end. 
We’ll sort out the facts for you. 
Assault-style guns in both attacks 
In both shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic — the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger — and carrying enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes. 
The New York Times reported that the El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds; and that the Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds. 
Terminology problem
We’ll note that ""assault weapon"" does not have a universal definition. For example, a bill called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018 defined an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, before expiring. 
""None of the so-called ‘assault rifles’ legally owned by U.S. civilians are assault rifles as the term is used in military contexts,"" said Florida State University criminal justice professor emeritus Gary Kleck, who has done research on large-capacity firearms used by mass shooters.
""Assault rifles used by members of the military can all fire full automatic, like machine guns, as well as one shot at a time, whereas none of the so-called ‘assault rifles’ legally owned by U.S. civilians can fire full automatic.""
But Kleck agreed that semiautomatic weapons evolved from earlier military weapons, many look like military weapons, and they can kill people rapidly.
The number of private weapons
Sanders campaign policy director Josh Orton acknowledged to us that the precise number of a particular type of weapon in civilian hands is not known, given there is no national gun registration. In fact, federal law prohibits there being a national registry.
But Orton argued that Sanders’ figure of 5-10 million of semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15, is a conservative estimate.
He cited a 2016 CNBC news article that quoted the National Rifle Association as saying there were 5 million AR-15s in circulation; he also cited other data suggesting the figure could be much higher. 
Harvard University gun researcher Deborah Azrael told us that her latest survey of gun owners showed there were about 90 million rifles in private hands in the United States in 2015. The survey did not ask about about AR-15s, but 5-10 million is plausible, said she and her colleague on the survey, Matthew Miller of Northeastern University.
As recently as June 2019, the NRA called a reported figure of more than 11 million AR-15s ""an arguably lowball figure."" 
Gun researchers including Kleck, Miller and Philip Cook of Duke University, cautioned us on relying on estimates made by the NRA or the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade association. Those figures could be inflated with the aim of making assault-style weapons appear common. 
""The fact is, we just don’t know"" the actual number, Miller said.
Aaron Karp, a senior consultant to the Small Arms Survey and a political science lecturer at Old Dominion University in Virginia, told us he believes Sanders’ estimate for private citizens is ""very conservative."" 
Karp estimates there are 15 million to 20 million assault-style weapons in the hands of Americans.
The number of military weapons 
Gun researchers we consulted told us they are not aware of any counts of assault-style weapons held by members of the military.
Sanders’ campaign pointed us to an estimate of 4.5 million from the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project based in Geneva, Switzerland. That is for all U.S. military-owned firearms, not assault-style weapons. But it would be exceeded by the estimated 5 million or more assault-style weapons in private hands.
Our ruling
Sanders said: ""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military. We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.""
There are no official counts of assault-style weapons, either in private hands or in the U.S. military.
But estimates that the civilian figure could be 5 million or more appear to be conservative and would exceed the estimated number of all weapons in the military. At the same time, those are semiautomatic weapons, not fully automatic like those used in the military.
We rate Sanders’ statement Half True."
14,"Dan McCready backed state legislation that raised consumers ""$149 million a year in higher energy costs.""","on Thursday, August 8th, 2019",http://politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2019/aug/08/club-growth/ad-misleads-about-dan-mccready-backing-bill-costin/,Mostly False,Club for Growth,Ad misleads about Dan McCready backing bill costing consumers $149 million | PolitiFact North Carolin,"Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready has made a name for himself as a clean-energy businessman in North Carolina. However, Club for Growth Action, a conservative-leaning PAC, has come after him for his energy business in a new attack ad.
""A tax-exempt special interest outfit McCready helped run pumped $450,000 into lobbying for costly state energy regulations that benefited McCready’s own business. Then, McCready handed you the bill. The cost to consumers here? $149 million a year in higher energy costs,"" the ad said.
McCready’s spokesman, Matthew Fried, said the ad’s claim that solar energy has raised rates is ""demonstrably false.""
When asked where it got the information for the ad, Club for Growth referenced an article from the Washington Examiner that echoed the claims made in the ad.
Why we’re checking this
We check claims that are widely shared or published; are about a topic of concern to many of our readers; can be proven or disproven through facts; and could cause people to act or vote in a certain way. This topic met all the criteria.
The race for the 9th Congressional District is going to be a close one. The Charlotte Observer reported last week that multiple GOP groups spent $4 million in ad buys against McCready. This means that this Club for Growth ad is one of many that will be popping up ahead of the Sept. 10 special election. 
Additionally, electricity is an important expense for many households.
The Club for Growth ad aims to convince voters that McCready lobbied in order to grow his renewable business at their expense.
Did McCready back ‘costly’ energy regulations?
Before McCready ran for Congress, he was the co-founder of Double Time Capital, an investment firm launched in 2013 that focuses on solar farms in North Carolina. Because of his involvement in sustainable energy, McCready was named a member of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association’s 2015-2016 board of directors, meaning he served on the board from January 2015 to December 2017.
The $450,000 figure could mislead voters, since it includes lobbying money spent before McCready joined the NCSEA board. But we decided to investigate specifically the most hard-hitting part of the ad, that he backed legislation that cost consumers money.
The ""costly state energy regulations"" the ad refers to is North Carolina’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, established in 2007, eight years before McCready was elected to the NCSEA board. It requires all investor-owned utilities in North Carolina to get 12.5% of their retail electricity sales from eligible renewable energy resources by 2021.
In 2015, a bill in the state House, House Bill 760, would have revised the standard to only require utilities to get 6% of their electricity from renewable energy resources. This legislation passed the House but died in committee in the Senate. A 2015 report from the North Carolina secretary of state’s office shows NCSEA spent $288,842.97 on lobbying that year.
We couldn’t find research showing what would have happened to costs if HB 760 had become law. But there are estimates about the cost of these standards more generally.
Did RPS cost taxpayers ‘$149 million a year?’
The Washington Examiner article quotes a study by Utah State University and Strata Policy. A 2017 update of the study estimates RPS costs residential electricity consumers $149 million, or $34 per person and a 2.3% increase in cost to residential consumers.
The credibility of this study has been contested by left-leaning groups.
David Pomerantz, executive director of the liberal-leaning Energy and Policy Institute, said the study may have been tied to the oil industry because of funding the university received from an oil mogul. The head researcher, Randy Simmons, served as the Charles G. Koch Professor of Political Economy at Utah State from 2008 to 2013. He said this is just one element of a ""fatally flawed"" study.
""The lynchpin of the study’s ‘economic analysis’ is that it looked at how states that passed RPS laws fared economically before they passed compared to how they fared after they passed. That method conveniently (if you want a skewed outcome) takes advantage of the fact that many states passed their RPS right around the time of the onset of the 2008 recession,"" Pomerantz said in an email interview with the News & Observer.
We looked into this issue and found that there are many different studies on the effects of RPS, and their estimates of the program’s overall cost range from slight savings to cost increases. Lori Bennear, a professor of energy economics and policy at Duke University said this is because of ""methodological challenges in isolating the impact of RPS’s on electricity costs.""
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory did a comprehensive study that found RPS could cause energy cost savings of up to 0.7% or a cost increase of up to 0.8%.
Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and an expert on the regulation of housing, land, energy, the environment, transportation, and labor, pointed to a study from the University of Chicago which estimated cost increases of 11-17% of retail rates.
The study estimated that RPS can cost from $115 to $530 per metric ton of reduced carbon dioxide emissions, a much higher cost than has been estimated elsewhere.
Of course, the renewable standards have benefits, too, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But the University of Chicago study cited estimates by the Obama administration that damages caused by climate change have a ""social cost"" of about $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, much less than the study's calculation of the cost of RPS.
A range of studies estimate that renewable standards do increase electricity rates. How much rates increase is estimated from less than 1% to 17% of retail rates. However, the Club for Growth ad misses the benefits of renewable energy, Bennear said.
Our ruling
The Club for Growth ad says McCready backed regulations that would cost consumers $149 million a year in their electric bills.
While it is true that the clean-energy group pushed to keep a renewable portfolio standard in North Carolina, the standard had already been established for close to a decade at the time McCready joined the group’s board.
It is misleading to say that NCSEA lobbied for ""costly state regulations"" when RPS had already been in the law for years before the House put forward legislation that would have watered it down.
The ad gives an exact figure for the costs of the standard, but experts told us that estimates on the effects of RPS vary widely, ranging from savings to costs.
What’s more, the ad fails to mention that renewable energy decreases toxic and costly carbon dioxide emissions.
Therefore, we rate this statement Mostly False.
Correction: A previous version of this story had incorrect figures for the estimated cost of carbon dioxide emissions and a University of Chicago study's estimate of the cost of renewable standards per metric ton of reduced carbon emissions. This does not change our ruling.

15,"""After (the assault weapon ban) passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again.""","on Wednesday, August 7th, 2019",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/07/bill-clinton/did-mass-shooting-deaths-fall-under-1994-assault-w/,Half-True,Bill Clinton,Did mass shooting deaths fall under the 1994 assault weapon ban? Checking Bill Clinton's claim,"It is one of the most controversial gun control policies: A ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines that allow shooters to keep firing longer without reloading.
While defining what is and isn’t an assault weapon is hard, singling out the broad class of firearms the term conveys is not. Following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, former President Bill Clinton invoked the ban that passed on his watch.
""How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban and the limit on high-capacity magazines and pass universal background checks?"" Clinton tweeted Aug. 5. ""After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now.""
How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban & the limit on high-capacity magazines & pass universal background checks? After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now.— Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) August 5, 2019 
Clinton touched back on the trend in an op-ed for Time on Aug. 8. So we wanted to check it out.
We’ve dug into the general question of the impact of the 1994 law before. This is the first time we examine its specific tie to mass shooting deaths, and whether the death toll rose after the ban ended. (Clinton’s tweet assumes that the presence or absence of the ban changed the number of mass shooting deaths. Proving cause and effect is a heavy lift.)
The topic is riddled with tough data challenges. The law banned only certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Should rampages using other kinds of assault-style weapons count? Plus, mass shootings happen much less frequently than other gun crimes, which puts any scientific analysis at a disadvantage.
That said, the evidence shows that mass shooting deaths rose in the years after the ban. The drop during the ban is less clear cut. The impact of the law is debated, but some researchers say that data and logic show that limits on large capacity magazines and assault weapons help reduce fatalities.
A limited law
The 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. People who owned such weaponry could keep it. When the ban took effect, there were roughly 1 million assault weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons were equipped with large capacity magazines.
The ban expired in 2004.
In a key 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department, researcher Christopher Koper wrote, ""The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually.""
""Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,"" Koper wrote.
Clinton’s new data
Clinton’s office cited a 2019 study from New York University’s School of Medicine. A group led by epidemiologist Charles DiMaggio homed in on mass shooting deaths. (Other research has tracked the number of times mass shootings happened, which is not the same thing.)
Researchers define mass shootings in different ways. Following the FBI’s definition, DiMaggio’s group looked at incidents where at least four people died.
In raw numbers, they found that mass shooting deaths fell during the years of the ban, and rose afterwards. DiMaggio shared his data. 

""During the ban period, there were fewer bodies,"" DiMaggio said.
The death toll from mass shootings went from 4.8 per year during the ban years to 23.8 per year afterwards.
Many factors drive gun deaths. To help account for those, DiMaggio’s team put mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearm homicides. Viewed that way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the yearly rate fell by 7-9 people per 10,000 firearm homicides. 
There’s room for debate over what happened to death rates, in contrast to raw numbers, before and during the ban. 
""There is some evidence they actually declined — or at least didn’t continue to increase during the period of the ban,"" DiMaggio said.
Epidemiologists speak in terms of risk; that is, the odds of something bad happening. DiMaggio’s study concluded that mass shooting deaths were 70% less likely during the ban. 
The ban’s impact remains unclear
On the key policy question of whether the ban drove the decline, DiMaggio urges caution.
""It is pretty much impossible to prove cause and effect,"" he said.
That’s the consensus among a number of researchers. Philip Cook at Duke University said the death toll is real, but complicated.
""Violence rates were quite volatile during that period generally for reasons that had nothing to do with gun regulation,"" Cook said. ""That doesn’t mean that the ban was ineffective — only that we don’t know and probably cannot determine the answer given that the outcome of interest (mass shootings) is so rare."" 
The drop of 15 mass shooting deaths from before the ban to during it is a slender difference on which to base firm conclusions.
Economist Rosanna Smart at RAND, a consulting nonprofit research group, agreed that mass shootings rose after the ban ended, but noted, ""I don’t think (DiMaggio’s) methods are well-suited for determining the causal impact of the assault weapons ban.""
In a 2018 article, Smart reviewed two studies on the impact of the ban. She said strictly in terms of statistical methods, the results were ""inconclusive."" Although one report did find that state-level bans were effective at reducing mass shooting death rates.
Refocusing on larger magazines
The debate over the value of a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines often includes Christopher Koper at George Mason University. Koper wrote the 2004 study that gave both sides in the gun control debate material to lean on.
Recently, Koper has spent more time assessing the role of large capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. 
In an article, Koper wrote that more than the semiautomatic weapons themselves, the latest data ties the larger magazines to a rising death toll.
""Considering that mass shootings with high capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place,"" Koper wrote in an article to be published in a few months.
Democrats introduced a legislation to block people from buying large capacity magazines.
Semiautomatic rifles account for a small percentage of deaths, but there are a lot of them. According to the industry trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation, yearly sales averaged about 200,000 during the years of the ban. In the eight years after the ban ended, sales averaged about 700,000 a year.
Our ruling
Clinton urged lawmakers to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. ""After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again,"" he said.
Clinton spoke too strongly about the drop. In simple numbers, mass shooting deaths fell during the ban years —15 deaths over the course of the decade. But statistically, that number is too small to allow strong conclusions. Even the author of the report Clinton relied on said the death rate might have declined —or levelled off.
The rise after the ban expired is supported by the evidence, although definitions of mass shootings will vary.
The role of the ban remains unclear, but Clinton’s statement did not specifically say that the ban was the key factor.
Clinton exaggerated the decline but was right about the rise. We rate this claim Half True."
114,"Says Keanu Reeves said, ""For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year.

The item appears on the website supporttrumppresidency.blogspot.com, and contains a banner headline that reads: ""For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him.""
But neither the text contained in the body of the article, nor a video embedded in the post, supports the emphatic headline.
The body of the article is entirely unrelated to politics. It tells an anecdote of Reeves' experience on set during the shooting of the 1994 action film Speed, co-starring Sandra Bullock.
The video at the end of the post shows an interview Reeves did with a journalist in Uruguay, in which he discussed his early career and current film projects.
Neither the text nor the video mentions politics, much less the actor's views on Trump.
In fact, the only instance we found of Reeves discussing Trump publicly is when he appeared to criticize the president’s travel ban during a January 2017 question-and-answer with journalists at a red carpet event.
Reeves told a journalist he believed the travel ban was ""just terrible,"" according to a Jan. 31, 2017, Associated Press article.
The only other references we found to Reeves' putative support for Trump were from other dubious websites that repeated the same baseless quote.
Reeves' publicist confirmed the quote is fake.
""It is completely false,"" said Cheryl Maisel, of talent agency PMK-BNC. ""He never made those comments nor did he ever do that interview. All manufactured."" 
This is not the first time Reeves has been the subject of a fake quote. We previously checked a lengthy cultural critique misattributed to Reeves, which we rated Pants on Fire.
Our ruling
Bloggers said Reeves described Trump as the symbol of success and a role model for young Americans.
We found no evidence he actually said these words.

214,"Says ""Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen.""","on Friday, September 9th, 2016",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/sep/09/american-future-fund/ad-attacking-patrick-murphy-among-least-effective-/,Mostly False,American Future Fund,Ad attacking Patrick Murphy as among 'least effective' in Congress misses the mark | PolitiFact Florid,"A conservative organization portrays U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, as a ""fabulously phony failure"" in a TV ad.
Murphy is taking on Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio in one of the most closely watched Senate battles in the nation.
In the ad, American Future Fund says, ""Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen.""
The fund is a political nonprofit organization that does not have to disclose its donors and has spent millions of dollars this election cycle largely attacking Democrats.
We will explain the basis of that claim and the shortcomings of the evidence.
(The ad also states that Murphy distorted his work record related to being a certified public accountant and small business owner. We have fact-checked similar attacks about his resume .)
‘Faulty analysis’
The ad cites an InsideGov ranking of members of Congress, as well as a Tampa Bay Times blog about the ranking. InsideGov is a product of Graphiq, a technology company that amasses data. We have previously dissected that ranking in a misleading attack by Murphy’s primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando.
Murphy was first elected in 2012. The InsideGov ranking was published in August 2015, and only deals with Murphy’s tenure through 2014. That was when Murphy was a Democratic freshman with little seniority in the Republican-controlled Congress. The tally does not include bills introduced in the current 114th Congress (Jan. 3, 2015-Jan. 3, 2017) since they still have time to pass bills.
InsideGov ranked Murphy as the 21st least-effective member. The list is stacked with rookies — 21 of the politicians named ""least effective"" have served four years or less. It’s also overwhelmingly filled with Democrats, the minority party in the House since 2011.
The main problem with this ranking is it’s based on a single measure: the percentage of bills sponsored by each member over their time in office that went on to pass committee. That’s not a sufficient way to rate the effectiveness of a member of Congress.
Congressional experts have repeatedly told us that there are many other ways to evaluate the effectiveness of a member beyond getting a sponsored bill passed in committee. Members can get language included in other bills, co-sponsor bills, hold hearings, negotiate agreements or provide constituent service (for example, help with getting Social Security benefits). A member might only pass one bill, but it could be a particularly important one.
Roy Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, called the InsideGov analysis ""clickbait garbage.""
""It is a well-known fact that members of the House minority are naturally disadvantaged in having their bills reported by the committees controlled by their opponents,"" he said.
Meyers said that among political scientists, the most sophisticated attempt to evaluate legislator effectiveness that has been done recently was created by Craig Volden, a University of Virginia professor, and Alan Wiseman, a Vanderbilt University professor.
Their ""Legislative Effectiveness Score"" measures how successful a representative is at moving his or her own bills through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills is also coded for its substantive significance. Then the professors compare members to average scores relative to those in a similar party status (majority or minority), level of seniority, and chair position (committee or subcommittee chair).
In the 113th Congress, Patrick Murphy scored 0.350. An average minority-party member with his seniority (freshman term) would be expected at 0.391. So Murphy is slightly lower than the average but considered to be close enough.
""So he meets expectations according to our criteria,"" Volden told PolitiFact Florida.   
GovTrack, a website that tracks congressional legislation, publishes an annual report card with rankings in various categories rather than just one. For example, it ranked Murphy as No. 2 among House Democrats for writing bipartisan bills in 2015.
""We would never reduce effectiveness to a single number (and we don't generally make value judgments about whether a member is doing a good or bad job),"" said Josh Tauberer, founder of GovTrack. ""InsideGov's analysis demonstrates a total failure to understand how politics works.""
Murphy’s campaign pointed to instances of him getting bill language out of a committee as a freshman.
In May 2013, Murphy introduced HR 1974, a bill that would have changed how the Small Business Administration gave out loans for businesses rebuilding after a disaster. Instead of being reported out of committee, Murphy’s language was attached to HR 4121 as an amendment along with other SBA-related changes and sent from the Small Business Committee to the House. No action was taken on the bill.
In October 2013, Murphy was a cosponsor and co-author of HR 3329, a bill concerning banking regulations. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., was listed as the sponsor, but Murphy’s campaign noted he and Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., managed the bill in the House. In the Congressional Record, Capito credited Murphy for writing the bill with Luetkemeyer. The bill eventually became law.
Rubio himself has taken credit for legislative victories by getting language inserted into other bills, so he considers that a measure of effectiveness.
His campaign also cited examples of Murphy playing a role in legislation passed during the current session of Congress that wasn’t included in the InsideGov analysis.
For example, in April the House unanimously passed the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act introduced by Murphy and U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla. The bill will allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace. It hasn’t received a vote in the Senate yet.
Our ruling
The American Future Fund ad said,""Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen.""
This is based on a ranking of one group that narrowly looks at Murphy’s record by only including bills he sponsored that passed out of committee through 2014. Congressional experts have told us that there are multiple ways to influence legislation and be an effective member which aren’t captured by this analysis of only part of his tenure.
The ad also omits that as a freshman Democrat, Murphy had little chance of getting legislation through committee. The majority of members on the ""least effective"" list are freshmen Democrats. Another analysis shows that he met expectations for a freshman of the minority party.
The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

314,"Says Ronald Reagan ""talked about"" converting the United States to the metric system.","on Sunday, June 7th, 2015",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/07/lincoln-chafee/lincoln-chafee-says-ronald-reagan-talked-about-con/,Half-True,Lincoln Chafee,Lincoln Chafee says Ronald Reagan talked about converting to the metric system,"When former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee announced he was joining the 2016 Democratic primary race, some people scratched their heads when he said switching to the metric system would be one of his goals as president.
Of the world’s major countries, only the United States, Liberia and Myanmar don’t use metric units as their primary measurement systems. Instead, America uses U.S. customary units. CNN anchor Dana Bash asked Chafee about his desire to have the country use meters instead of feet and kilometers instead of miles in a June 7 interview.
Noting that he lived in Canada while they converted to the metric system in the 1970s, Chafee said this discussion has been going on for a while in the United States.
""I know many in the scientific community, the health care community that deal internationally, the business community, are saying this is way overdue,"" he said. ""(Former President) Ronald Reagan talked about it. Others have talked about it.""
It’s amazing how often politicians use Reagan’s name as a way to advance their cause. In this case, we wondered if Chafee’s claim measures up.
Falling short
In 1975, Former President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act, which created the United States Metric Board, charged with leading the planning and educational efforts for switching over to the metric system. (Check out this delightful cartoon about converting to the metric system from 1975.)
So when Reagan took office in 1981, a government-backed push for metric conversion -- also known as metrication -- was already well underway. However, the Metric Board had limited effectiveness in that there was no mandatory conversion timeline, and the board included some members who actually opposed conversion.
In 1982, Reagan effectively dismantled the metrication effort by stripping funding from the Metric Board. The group morphed into the Office of Metric Programs, under the Department of Commerce, with much less responsibility and less than a fifth of the budget.
That year’s federal budget also cut a $2 million Department of Education program for metric education, according to the New York Times.
The Reagan administration justified the Metric Board cut as part of a general reduction in federal spending, rather than opposition to conversion -- preferring to leave conversion to the private sector. Reagan’s budget proposal said, ""The board has accomplished its mission to familiarize the public with the metric system. Voluntary metrication will continue through market adjustments.''
The U.S. Metric Association, a current group dedicated to metric conversion, dug into this issue with Reagan Library materials. They found more than one piece of correspondence indicating that Reagan’s action against the Metric Board did ""not imply a lack of support for voluntary metrication.""
It’s worth noting that Frank Mankiewicz, a former Democratic strategist and National Public Radio president, took at least partial credit for killing the Metric Board -- having convinced a top Reagan adviser that metrication could damage the country.
We looked through newspaper archives with LexisNexis and found that for nearly the rest of the Reagan administration, there was very little talk of metric conversion, at least in Washington. (Other than in 1985, when the U.S. ambassador to Canada resigned in part because he called the Canadian metrication process ""rubbish."")
But in 1988, his last year in office, Reagan signed into law an omnibus trade bill that included a slight amendment to the 1975 Metric Conversion Act. Tucked into the 1,000-page bill was a declaration that the metric system was ""the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce"" and called for federal agencies to switch to the metric system wherever practical by 1992.
While supporters of metrication saw this as a win because it had a timeline for implementation and a directive for federal agencies, unlike the earlier legislation, some believed the bill was without teeth because it allowed agencies an economic out from conversion, according to news reports from the time.
It’s unclear how much influence Reagan had over this amendment to the Metric Conversion Act because it went over with little fanfare, and we were unable to track down any relevant White House statement.
Reagan’s successor, President George H.W. Bush, further solidified that directive with an executive order in 1991.
All in all, the Reagan administration seemed ambivalent toward metrication, at best.
Today, not all, but many federal agencies -- including the military -- use metric units almost exclusively, according to a statement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Many metric experts estimate that the United States is 50 percent metric, said U.S. Metric Association President Don Hillger, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. While most Americans use customary units in their homes, those in science and heavy industry typically use the metric system.
He added that there is no longer a standard yard or pound because U.S. customary units are defined by their metric equivalents.
""So we really are on the metric standard in the U.S.,"" Hillger said. ""It’s just that we continue to use non-metric units that no other major country uses anymore.""
Our ruling
Chafee said, ""Reagan talked about"" converting to the metric system.
The issue of metrication rose at the very beginning and at the very end of Reagan’s presidency. However, Chafee’s statement implies that Reagan had more than a passing interest in the issue, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
The metrication process started before Reagan took office. He slowed the process to a standstill by taking away funding. He was silent on the issue for the next six years until he signed a law that directed federal agencies to make a more concerted effort to transition to metric units when practical -- though it’s unclear how much influence Reagan’s White House had on that tiny aspect of a 1,000-page omnibus bill.
Without this additional context, Chafee’s claim is off by a few yards. Or meters. We rate the claim Half True."
390,"Says Mark Begich ""has taken campaign cash from the Kochs"" while Dan Sullivan hasn’t.","on Monday, May 19th, 2014",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/19/dan-sullivan/gop-opponent-says-mark-begich-took-campaign-money-/,Mostly False,Dan Sullivan,GOP opponent says Mark Begich took campaign money from Koch brothers,"In Alaska, no U.S. Senate candidate wants to be tied to the billionaire Koch brothers. Back-and-forth ads between incumbent Mark Begich, a Democrat, and former Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican frontrunner, have both slung accusations of Koch affiliation.
A pro-Begich super PAC, Put Alaska First, fired the first shot in April. It released the ad ""Lost,"" which criticized Sullivan for not doing enough to prevent the Koch-owned refinery from closing, resulting in a loss of 80 jobs.
""Dan Sullivan remains silent about the jobs being lost here,"" the ad said. ""And those same billionaires, the Koch brothers, are supporting his campaign.""
The next week Sullivan released a radio ad: ""Dan Sullivan has never taken a dime from the Koch brothers,"" the narrator said. ""It’s Begich who has taken campaign cash from the Kochs.""
As a Democrat, Begich wouldn’t be a typical recipient of Koch funds. So we decided to fact-check whether the attack was accurate.
Our colleagues at FactCheck.org pointed out that although Sullivan hasn’t accepted money directly from the Koch brothers or their affiliates, the Koch-backed Americans For Prosperity has spent nearly $1 million on Begich attack ads. Sullivan isn't receiving those funds, but he does benefit from an attack on his opponent that can't be legally coordinated directly between the candidate and the group.
As for Begich, we found that KochPAC, a Koch Industries group, gave $5,000 to Begich’s Great Land PAC back in 2010. Begich’s PAC primarily gives money to candidates, as well as state and federal Democratic parties.
In 2010, the Kochs also gave money to Democratic senators like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Chuck Schumer. In 2013 and 2014, they haven’t given any money to Democratic Senate candidates, and just three Democratic House candidates.
A spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said she’d be surprised to see much Koch money going to Democrats this cycle.
A Koch Industries spokesman told Politico in March 2014 that KochPAC doesn’t base its donations on the candidate’s party, but rather on the company’s business and policy interests.
Our ruling
Sullivan said Mark Begich ""has taken campaign cash from the Kochs"" but that Sullivan ""hasn’t taken a dime."" In 2010, KochPAC donated $5,000 to a Begich-affiliated PAC. But that's a modest amount by campaign-finance standards, and Begich hasn’t received any more in the past four years.
While Sullivan hasn’t received money directly from the Kochs, he and Begich’s other Republican challengers certainly benefit from the much larger TV ad buys by Koch-affiliated groups attacking the Democrat. A Koch-funded group, Americans For Prosperity, has spent nearly $1 million in Alaska benefiting Sullivan and other Republicans in the race.

Controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act isn’t going away anytime soon.
Republicans have vowed to make Obamacare a central theme of the 2014 campaign, while Democrats insist that troubles with the initial rollout are subsiding and that millions of Americans now have health insurance as a result of the law. A new congressional report on the law, meanwhile, appears to stoke potential arguments on both sides.
U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby toured Oregon recently, meeting with 100 business owners in as many days. Wehby is running for the GOP nomination to face Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. During a stop in La Grande, Wehby said the new law threatens to hinder Oregon’s efforts to dig out of the Great Recession.
""We obviously have a lot of concerns about the health care law,"" she told a gathering of about 15 people at a La Grande coffee shop. ""People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result of the law.""
There have been many claims about the Affordable Care Act, but this one caught our attention. Is the law causing businesses to shrink? PolitiFact Oregon checked.
We contacted Wehby’s campaign and got a response from Charlie Pearce, her communications manager. In addition to providing links to national news stories reporting that some major companies are cutting employee hours to avoid ACA-related insurance costs, he directed us to Robert Decker, owner of Westcare Healthcare Management in Salem, a company that operates health care facilities for veterans and the disabled in several states.
Decker said costs associated with the new law prompted him to sell three care facilities in Idaho in 2012. When he ran the numbers, he found it would cost him between $800,000 and $1 million to provide health insurance for the 650 employees he had in Idaho at the time. Spending that much money on insurance, Decker said, would have rendered those businesses unprofitable.
""The health care law was a big driving force in our selling those facilities,"" Decker said. ""It had a big impact on us, no question.""
Two supervisors with the company that bought the bulk of Westcare Management’s Idaho holdings confirmed the March 2012 sale. Both declined to give their names, saying they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the transaction. The company’s human resources director did not return our calls.
To gauge the accuracy of Decker’s health-care costs claim, we called T.J. Sullivan, a partner in Huggins Insurance in Salem. His agency has been advising Oregon businesses on how the health care law affects them.
The average premium for ACA-approved business plans runs about $250 to $300 a month, he said, with management picking up about half of that. Assuming costs of $125 per month for 650 workers, Westcare Management’s costs under the new law would run roughly $975,000 annually, Sullivan said. On that score, Decker’s assertion checks out.
Decker’s company is privately held and he declined to discuss profits, however, so we weren’t able to independently verify that a cost of $800,000 to $1 million would have rendered the businesses unprofitable.
Sullivan said he has seen effects of the new law locally, as well.
One provision, the so-called employer mandate, has been delayed until 2015. It requires businesses that employ more than 50 people --  who all work at least 30 hours a week -- to provide insurance to their workers. However, Sullivan said he is working with at least one Salem-area company in that category that’s trimming hours to get employees under 30 per week.
The company has multiple locations and employs about 100 Salem-area residents. The company’s owner, Sullivan said, is aiming to trim work hours to get 60 to 75 of those employees under the 30-hour threshold. The owner isn’t hiring workers to fill the gap -- nor laying anyone off, Sullivan said.
He declined to name the company, saying that he wanted the owner to speak for himself. The owner did not return our calls. From Sullivan’s description, however, the business is ""shrinking.""
A new report from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the new law will mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021 as hours are reduced. The report contains an important caveat, however, in noting that many of those losses will be voluntary as people opt to keep their incomes low to remain eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid.
Next, we wondered whether state employment data reflect either trend -- larger companies not hiring that 51st employee or smaller ones hiring more part-time employees to avoid health-insurance requirements.
Not according to a blog entry posted Nov. 6, 2013, by Josh Lehner, senior economist in the state Office of Economic Analysis.
""Here in Oregon,"" Lehner wrote, ""over 90 percent of the jobs added between 2009 and 2012 have been full-time positions, on net.""
Later in the post, he added, ""Of course, the so-called ‘employer mandate’ under the health law doesn’t take effect until 2015, so it’s possible that employers are simply waiting to cut hours until closer to the deadline. But there’s little evidence they’ve started yet.""
Clarity on the issue may not be coming anytime soon. According to Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, ""This is a really tough one to get a handle on. Even after enough time has passed for the impacts of the law to show up in the aggregate data, these impacts will be difficult to isolate.""
Oregon, like the rest of the country, continues to wrestle with the Affordable Care Act. The two major political parties are largely split on whether it represents government overreach or the best way to control health-care spending while providing insurance to those who don’t have it.
Wehby told a small audience in La Grande that ""People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result.""
It’s true that Wehby said businesses are ""having"" to shrink their operations. There’s a nuance there suggesting businesses are being compelled to make cuts. Because we can’t assess motives, we chose to look more narrowly at whether businesses are or are not making cutbacks in response to the law, accepting that the overwhelming majority would be acting with their businesses’ bottom line in mind.
Wehby’s campaign provided an example of a significant scaling back of an Oregon-based business, though aspects could not be independently verified. She also gave us links to national news stories reporting similar cuts elsewhere. An Oregon consultant also outlined an example of a business trimming employee hours as a result of the law.

414,"""25% of human trafficking victims are located in Texas.""","on Wednesday, January 29th, 2014",http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jan/29/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-claim-misinterprets-outdated-human-tra/,Pants on Fire!,John Cornyn,John Cornyn claim that a quarter of human trafficking victims are located in Texas relies on outdated limited-scope figure | PolitiFact Texas,"U.S. Sen. John Cornyn recently wrote: ""January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, a sobering reminder that even as we enter the year 2014, people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking.
""Tragically, these horrendous crimes are occurring at an alarming rate in our own state,"" the Texas Republican said. ""25% of human trafficking victims are located in Texas."" The email went on to mention Cornyn’s introduction of legislative proposals to ""help law enforcement track down and prosecute these criminals, and provide support for the victims of these crimes.""
Merriam-Webster defines human trafficking as ""organized criminal activity in which human beings are treated as possessions to be controlled and exploited (as by being forced into prostitution or involuntary labor).""
Are one in four of all trafficking victims located in Texas?
Megan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cornyn, who seeks election to a third term, told us by email that the senator relied on an undated ""fact sheet"" from the Texas Sex Trafficking Obliteration Project, overseen by the conservative Concerned Women of America, and a Sept. 16, 2009, report by Texas-based Children at Risk, a nonprofit focused on the ""root causes of poor public policies affecting children.""
The sheet says: ""25% of all human trafficking victims are in Texas,"" attributing that without elaboration to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
‘Certified’ victims only
The Children at Risk report gives detail, stating: ""In the last quarter of 2007, 30% of the calls received by the National Human Trafficking Hotline originated in Texas and 25% of all international victims certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were located in Texas. As of the date (of) publication, the National Human Trafficking Hotline receives more calls from Texas than from any other state.""
According to the report, Texas is a ""hub for international human trafficking because of its many busy interstate highways, international airports, bus stations, the shipping commerce through the Gulf of Mexico, and its shared border with Mexico… Texas is also a hotspot for domestic human trafficking because cities such as Dallas, Houston and Austin have many runaway and homeless youth.""
By email, Dawn Lew, a staff attorney for Children at Risk, told us the reference to the last quarter of 2007 applied only to the hotline calls and said the 25 percent reference reflected the percentage of all international trafficking victims ""certified"" by the HHS who were located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006.
Also, Lew pointed us toward a web page for the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, dated Oct. 2, 2012, stating that under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, adult victims of severe forms of trafficking in the country from another place can become eligible for federal and state services otherwise offered to refugees. To qualify, individuals must be ""certified"" as trafficking victims by HHS, according to the web page, meaning they must: be a victim of a severe form of trafficking; be willing to assist in every reasonable way in the investigation and prosecution of severe forms of trafficking or be unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma; and have cleared immigration paperwork hurdles. Child victims do not need such certification, the page says.
Lew subsequently noted a July 2012 federal report stating that in 2002, certification letters for 99 individuals were sent to benefit-issuing offices in 14 states. The report said: ""The largest concentrations of victims were located in Texas (31.3%), Florida (19.2%), and California (14.1%).""
Another Children at Risk official called and said Cornyn’s statement could have been worded differently.
The official, Mandi Kimball, later said by email that Cornyn’s 25 percent reference was in the context of talking up his legislation targeting trafficking within the United States.
""We have no idea how many people are being trafficked in Texas or any state for that matter,"" Kimball wrote. ""We do know that 25% of the"" foreign ""victims located and certified in the country from April 2004-January 2006 were located in Texas. Cornyn is not saying that 25% of the victims were being trafficked in Texas, he stated that they were located in Texas. This is the 25% number that people are going by, because it is the only concrete data and number we have to go by, and this data is from"" HHS.
Do these counts add up?
Generally, Lew said earlier, states are under-estimating trafficking victims. ""This is because it is difficult and nearly impossible to quantify the true number of victims,"" Lew said. ""Why? Because victims often don’t self-identify as victims, some are misidentified and charged as criminals for related offenses (drugs, criminal trespass, etc.), and others, due to the clandestine nature of human trafficking, are hiding in plain sight and may never encounter law enforcement or social service providers,"" Lew wrote.
""In addition, although human trafficking has always existed, until recently, not all states even had a state law on human trafficking, which contributes to the lack of information at the state level on the number of victims identified, traffickers convicted, etc.,"" Lew said. ""Certification numbers are some of the only concrete data that we have with respect to the number of human trafficking victims in each state, and it’s clear that many of the victims are being certified from Texas. Again, keep in mind that certification only captures a percentage of international victims, and does not include domestic victims at all. So the problem in Texas, as in most every state, is larger.""
At Lew’s suggestion, we reached Maria Trujillo, executive director of the Houston Rescue and Restore Coalition, which says its mission is educate the public, train professionals and empower the community to act toward identifying, rescuing and restoring trafficking victims to freedom.
By phone, Trujillo said the Cornyn-cited statistic may have held up in 2006--though then solely for adult victims from outside the United States, since certification does not sweep in citizen-victims. Also, she said, the government has not released figures since then that would bring the estimate up to date.
After 2006, Trujillo said, the government stopped estimating the number of certified adult victims on a state-by-state level, though national figures continued to be available.
Kenneth Wolfe, spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, which is an HHS agency, told us by email that it is unable to calculate how many victims of human trafficking are in the United States or within any state. Wolfe said the agency has not lately reported which states got the most letters certifying international victims ""because the information might be misinterpreted as the location of the trafficking, which is often not the case."" Nationally in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, he said, such letters were provided to victims or their representatives in 38 states. Certified victims, he said, came from 55 countries.
Texas vs. the world
We were curious to see how the scope of trafficking in Texas stacks up with other places in the world, some of them notorious for human trafficking. Cornyn’s statement, after all, said that 25 percent of trafficking victims are in Texas just one sentence after he said that ""people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking.""
Globally, Trujillo said, the only recent estimate of trafficking victims that she recommends came from the International Labour Federation, a United Nations agency, which estimated there were nearly 21 million victims in 2012. ""I am comfortable with that figure, I am comfortable with their research,"" Trujillo said. ""... It is still an estimate. No one can ever know the true number because it is such a covert crime.""
A U.N. report published in December 2012 describes the organization’s estimate of 20.9 million individuals in forced labor, including for sexual exploitation. ""While it is not known how many of these victims were trafficked, the estimate implies that currently, there are millions of trafficking-in-persons victims in the world,""  the report says, further specifying that per U.S. State Department figures, there were 449 adults and 92 children from foreign countries certified as U.S. victims of trafficking in the fiscal year that ran through September 2010.
The U.N. agency’s executive summary describes the survey-based methodology for its estimate, also saying that Asia accounts for 56 percent of the estimated global total with Africa accounting for 18 percent of victims. ""Developed economies"" including the United States, the summary says, account for 1.5 million, or 7 percent, of the victims.
Informed of the unavailability of recent estimates and the fact that the original estimate was limited to certified victims from outside the country, Mitchell of Cornyn’s office said by email that his statement relied on the ""most recent Texas-specific data available.""
Our ruling
Cornyn said 25 percent of trafficking victims are located in Texas.
This claim seemingly draws on an outdated percentage for a subset of the planet’s trafficking victims, that is, ""certified"" adult victims from outside the U.S. described some five years ago as located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006--and that calculation did not account for U.S. citizen-victims.
We did not find an estimate of the share of the world’s trafficking victims located in Texas, though the 2012 U.N. estimate seems to show that Texas is not home to a huge share; victims are more prevalent in Asia and Africa than in the developed world, the report said.
All told, this claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

514,"""We have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""","on Monday, September 24th, 2012",http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/24/tommy-thompson/us-has-more-natural-gas-saudi-arabia-has-oil-senat/,Mostly False,Tommy Thompson,"U.S. has more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil, Senate candidate Tommy Thompson says | PolitiFact Wisconsin","After speaking to the Milwaukee Rotary Club on Sept. 11, 2012, Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson took questions from the audience.

Asked about achieving energy independence, the former Republican governor called for several initiatives, including converting semitrailer trucks and buses so that they can burn compressed natural gas rather than diesel fuel.

After all, Thompson reasoned:

""We have more natural gas, ladies and gentlemen, than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

We do?

It turns out another GOP politician recently preceded Thompson down this road. Let’s see where it’s led them.

Jon Huntsman, the former presidential candidate and Utah governor, also referred to new sources of energy when making the same claim Thompson did during a GOP presidential debate in December 2011. PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly False, given that it is off based on two of three ways to measure the question.

1. In terms of proved resources -- those likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions -- Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves.

2. Saudi Arabia also comes out ahead when considering technically recoverable resources -- those that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost.

3. The U.S. leads Saudi Arabia only when comparing current production levels -- the U.S. produces more natural gas every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.

Even at that, reserves are more relevant than current production in terms of moving America toward energy independence.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration provided the statistics used by PolitiFact National. We checked back with the agency, which confirmed that each of the three statistics remains true.

Back to Thompson.

Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said Thompson ""clearly meant to say was that we produce more natural gas in this country every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.""

We don’t think it is so clear, given that Thompson made no mention of production.

Our rating

Thompson stated: ""We have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

The U.S. produces more natural gas than Saudi Arabia produces oil. But in terms of reserves -- those that are proved and those that are technically recoverable -- Saudi Arabia leads.

We rate Thompson’s statement Mostly False."
614,"On how he measures his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs in seven years.","on Tuesday, October 4th, 2011",http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/oct/04/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-changes-math-700000-jobs-pledge/,Full Flop,Rick Scott,"Gov. Rick Scott changes the math for '700,000 jobs' | PolitiFact Florid","Rick Scott, the candidate, ran on a platform of creating jobs. That's why the businessman-turned-politician won a bruising Republican primary last summer, he said. That's why he squeaked by Democrat Alex Sink in November 2010. ""That was my whole campaign,"" he said in February. ""Seven steps to 700,000 jobs over seven years.""

And more than a year since candidate Scott rolled out his 7-7-7 plan, Gov. Scott still talks frequently about those 700,000 jobs.

But just how do you keep track?

Scott the candidate offered one measure: ""Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs,"" he said in a debate a year ago, ""and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be."" Now Scott the governor is offering another. ""700,000,"" he told reporters Oct. 4, 2011, when asked how many jobs he promised to create.

""But the initial promise was to create 700,000 on top of projected growth,"" Scott was asked.

""No,"" Scott said.

While the creation of those jobs is a central promise we're tracking on the Scott-O-Meter, we wanted to rate Scott's statements about his promise on our Flip-O-Meter, which PolitiFact Florida created to measure whether a candidate's shifting on any particular position.

 Scott: 'We're going to grow 700,000 more jobs'

Let's rewind to July 2010. State economists had already estimated Florida's recession rebound — no matter who the new governor might be — would add more than 1 million jobs by 2017. On July 21, Scott unveiled his 7-7-7 plan. He would introduce ""accountability budgeting."" He would reduce government spending. He would cut regulation. He would focus on job growth and retention. He would invest in world-class universities. He would shrink property taxes. He would get rid of the state's corporate income tax. Those changes would create 665,000 jobs over seven years. He rounded up, and the 700,000 jobs promise was born.

Reporters wanted to know: If the state's expected growth alone was projected to restore 1 million jobs, did that mean Scott's structural changes to spending, regulation and the tax code would add 700,000 more?

""Are those jobs that are in addition to the number of jobs that are going to be created automatically, just without any change in tax policy over the next five or 10 years?"" a reporter asked Scott while traveling on his campaign bus. (We know, because we have the video.)

Scott answered yes, then pointed out that jobs aren't created automatically. The reporter then corrected himself.

""Well, projected. The job creation that is projected over the next five years,"" he said.

""It's what's projected, yeah. It's what's projected, yeah,"" Scott said, nodding. ""It's on top of that. If you do these things we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs."" 

Reporters had their answer. Scott's plan would ""grow 700,000 more jobs"" than Florida would generate without him.

Three months later, Scott made pretty much the same statement during a debate sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association. (We have video of that, too.)

""Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be,"" Scott said.

The debate moderator later noted that would mean creating about 1.7 million jobs, when only about 1 million Floridians were currently unemployed.

""We're going to grow the state,"" Scott responded.

In November, Florida elected the jobs governor.

 Scott: 'I don't know who said that'

Not long after that, Scott moved the goalpost.

The new promise: Create 700,000 jobs. Period.

In June, Scott spokesman Brian Burgess touted news that Florida had added 50,000 jobs since January, saying that Scott was going to count every one toward keeping his promise.

In the same few days, another Scott spokesman, Lane Wright, brushed off a question about Scott's original promise to create 700,000 jobs ""on top of what normal growth would be.""

""Gov. Scott committed to creating 700,000 jobs in seven years, and we are on track to meet that goal,"" Wright said.

In August, the governor himself weighed in. An Associated Press reporter reminded Scott that his jobs plan was designed to generate 700,000 jobs on top of those restored by the state's expected growth.

""No, that's not true,"" Scott said.

So, the reporter pushed, statements by his campaign were totally wrong?

""I don't know who said that,"" Scott said. ""I have no idea.""

Last week, the governor again faced the question he was asked as a candidate, nearly a year prior. This time, instead of a debate audience, Scott faced members of the Sun Sentinel editorial board.

""Your pledge was for 700,000 in addition to normal growth, wasn't it?'' Scott was asked.

No, he replied.

 

The problem with Scott's new position is that there are at least two times during the campaign -- captured on video -- where Scott said the exact opposite. And in both those cases, someone asked Scott a follow up question. And in both replies, Scott reinforced his position -- 700,000 jobs, on top of normal growth.

 

Now, Scott says it's just 700,000.


To be clear: That's a difference of about 1 million jobs.

 

The governor's plan was on the record, and it was specific. His policy changes, from regulatory reform to spending cuts, would result in job growth. Instead, his office has counted every net new private sector job — starting from before the governor had a chance to change policy. For the governor, that means a tally of more than 71,000 jobs since January. On the Flip-O-Meter, that counts as a Full Flop.

714,"Says Scott Bruun ""still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security.""","on Saturday, October 2nd, 2010",http://politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-scott-bruun-wants-privatize-soc/,Half-True,Kurt Schrader,Kurt Schrader says Scott Bruun wants to privatize Social Security | PolitiFact Oregon,"As sure as the sun rises each morning and more people ease into retirement, the future of Social Security becomes a boiling issue every election.

It’s happening again in the race for Oregon’s 5th congressional district. Incumbent Democrat Kurt Schrader has claimed that Republican Scott Bruun advocates ``privatizing Social Security.’’

It happened most recently during a Sept. 10 debate at the Salem City Clubwhen Schrader said this: `` ... My opponent apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize social security.’’

It’s a combustible allegation that could lead some voters to believe they would be at the mercy of an unpredictable stock market as they step into retirement. Many voters, especially older ones who rely on Social Security and who vote in high numbers, would not be pleased if they thought their cherished safety net was going to be less of a sure thing.

Schrader is just one of a big number of mostly Democratic candidates talking about Social Security and suggesting Republicans would leave seniors stranded. But is his claim accurate?

First, a little background is needed.

Social Security is a retirement and disability program guaranteed and fully funded by the U.S. government. That means if you qualify for benefits, the check will be delivered without fail each month just as it’s been since 1935 when Social Security was created by Congress.

It’s an enormously popular program that currently provides benefits to 53.4 million people. But it has a huge budget and it’s only getting more expensive as the population ages, a larger number of people qualify for benefits and fewer workers are left to shoulder the cost.

Here’s how AARP summarizes the dilemma: ``The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the reserve fund and payroll taxes will cover full payment of benefits through 2037.’’

That’s why Congress and politicians periodically float suggestions for saving Social Security. In 2005, President George W. Bush devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to a plan that would allow workers under age 55 the option of diverting up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into personal accounts. He argued that private investing could bring better returns while easing some of the fiscal pressure on Social Security.

The proposal died as most Democrats opposed it, as did some Republicans. Critics said that unscrupulous financial advisers would charge huge fees and that the stock market’s unpredictability could strand millions of seniors without the retirement nest egg they’d counted on.

And that brings us to 2010 and Schrader vs. Bruun.

Schrader’s claim is based on comments Bruun has made over the years, including an Oct. 22, 1996, letter to the editor published in The Oregonian. ``We can address this problem by growing the economy and by slowly converting contributions into private investments, which will earn a much higher rate of return,"" he wrote then.

Today, he takes a bit less muscular and more nuanced view. In the section of his campaign website devoted to issues, Bruun flatly states he does ``not support a complete privatization of Social Security.’’ At the same time, he would allow workers ``the option to invest a portion’’ of their payroll taxes in private accounts. That is essentially the same idea that crashed and burned in 2006.

``I am committed to pursuing bipartisan solutions to this challenge, and I am eager to look at any proposal that will protect Social Security benefits for today’s seniors without increasing taxes. I do not support a complete privatization of Social Security for younger workers, but I do believe that option to invest a portion of their payroll taxes to conservatively managed private equity accounts should be a choice available to future recipients of Social Security benefits,’’ Bruun says on his website.

So what about Schrader’s claim that Bruun ""apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security""?

Bruun does seem to be suggesting an approach similar to Bush’s in that he would allow younger workers to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds monitored by the government. But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security, which Bruun has said he does not support.

If he follows Bush, Bruun would change nothing for workers 55 and older. They would not be able to opt into a personal account.

And for younger workers (under 55 in Bush’s plan), the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised. Bruun’s spokeswoman Alee Lockman says Bruun has not suggested a specific age limit for workers who want to contribute to private funds. He says only ``younger workers.’

It’s beyond dispute that, if he’s elected to Congress, Bruun would vote to partially privatize Social Security. But Schrader exaggerates, suggesting that Bruun wants to fully privatize the system.

That’s simply not the case and it’s the reason we rate his claim Half True.

830,"""Congress only funded half the wall"" between Mexico and the United States.","on Friday, September 7th, 2007",http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/07/bill-richardson/remainder-of-money-in-pipeline/,Mostly True,Bill Richardson,Remainder of money in pipeline,"At the Democratic Univision debate on Sept. 9, 2007, candidate Bill Richardson said a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border was only half-funded by Congress. Here's his statement:

""This wall is a horrendous example of Washington misguided policy. Congress only funded half of the wall.""


Richardson got it mostly right, although Congress has taken steps to pay for additional portions. The ultimate cost is still uncertain, however.


In 2006, Congress approved building the wall in the Southwest to restrict undocumented workers' access into America. It will run 850 miles when built, according to the Congressional Research Service.


Congress has approved $1.2-billion to pay for it -- about half its estimated cost. But Richardon's statement gives the impression the funding has stopped. In fact, the White House and Congress have taken steps to pay for the remainder of the fence, although there is still some disagreement about what form the fence will ultimately take.


The White House requested another $1-billion in spending for the fence in 2008. The House approved the spending in June 2007 but with strict requirements because Democrats are skeptical of the proposal.


The Senate has not yet approved it."

Huckabee's statement that the amendment says ""everything in the world possible"" must be done to protect the unborn is pretty sharply limited by the phrase ""to the extent permitted by the federal Constitution."" At the moment, the

Roe v. Wade

decision means the federal Constitution permits abortion.


It also is a slight overstatement to say the Arkansas amendment declares a belief that life begins at conception, though that certainly is implied.

But the trends of declining marriage rates and births out of wedlock started before gay unions were legalized.


M.V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the research director of the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA, wrote a detailed study that examined rates for marriage and birth rates in Scandinavian countries.


""Marriage rates, divorce rates, and nonmarital birth rates have been changing in Scandinavia, Europe, and the United States for the past thirty years,"" Badgett writes. ""But those changes have occurred in all countries, regardless of whether or not they adopted same-sex partnership laws, and these trends were underway well before the passage of laws that gave same-sex couples rights.""


In, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, same-sex partnerships were legalized in 1989, 1993 and 1994, respectively. Generally speaking, gay partners in these countries have the legal and financial protections of marriage, but they are not allowed to marry in church or adopt children.


The county-level statistics Brownback cites about first-born births are correct, Badgett said, but that trend also started years before the legalization of same-sex unions.


Conservative author Stanley Kurtz is a prominent advocate of the argument that gay marriage hurts heterosexual marriage. Kurtz responded to Badgett's study by arguing that marriage rates in Scandinavia and other European countries are still declining, and that the legalization of same-sex partnerships ""reinforces and intensifies parental cohabitation.""


But even Kurtz acknowledges that the decline began before the legalization of same-sex unions.

Barelypolitical.com produced the video ""Debate 08: Obama Girl vs. Giuliani Girl,"" a follow up to their successful video ""I got a crush on Obama,"" which featured Amber Lee Ettinger lip-synching a song about the Democratic presidential candidate.


In the debate video, another dancer is introduced and the two argue about the merits of their respective candidates. At one point, Obama Girl raps, ""Giuliani Girl, just stop your fussing, at least Obama didn't marry his cousin.""


We find Obama Girl's claims are accurate.


In 1968, Giuliani wed his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, who was the daughter of his father's first cousin. (Think of your son/daughter marrying your cousin's daughter/son.)


Giuliani at different points labeled the family connection as ""second cousins once removed"" and ""third cousins,"" before he was corrected, according to news reports.
In a 1993 memo for his mayoral campaign, a Giuliani strategist noted the ""weirdness"" factor of the marriage, according to a copy posted on the Smoking Gun Web site. But such a marriage is completely legal. In New York, even first cousins can wed.
Robin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington, said little scientific research exists about the risk of developmental difficulties for the offspring of second cousins. But she said, ""for second cousins, the risks are likely similar to the risks of couples from the same ethnic population who also may have common ancestors.""


Giuliani and Peruggi did not have any children, and the marriage ended after 14 years."

In 2003, the phased-in cuts of 2001 were accelerated but McCain again voted no, saying taxes shouldn't be cut in time of war. But in 2006, when the cuts were extended, McCain voted yes because he said opposing the extension of cuts already in place would amount to a tax increase.

""If we just got African-Americans in Mississippi to vote their percentage of the population,"" he said, ""Mississippi is suddenly a Democratic state."" He said the same would happen in Georgia, and that South Carolina would be in play as well.

His claims about those states don't stand up very well to the math.


To begin with, African-Americans in Mississippi and Georgia already come close to voting their percentage of the population. The suggested gains, while they may be welcome, would not be large enough to turn the tide in these red states.


In the 2004 presidential election, blacks made up 34 percent of the voters who turned out in Mississippi, where they comprise 37 percent of the population. The numbers are similar in Georgia.
In South Carolina, blacks actually made up a slightly larger portion of Election Day voters than they did of the population.


Still, the Democratic candidate, John Kerry, went down to defeat in those states.


Enter Obama, who says his African-American heritage changes the game in 2008. What if blacks did vote their percentage of the population in the states he mentions?


Say he gets every black Mississippi vote that Kerry got in 2004. (about 352,500). Then say he gets the Mississippi white voters who supported Kerry (105,200). Then give him all of the 72,600 black voters who would turn out if Mississippi blacks voted their percentage of the population in 2008.


That's about 530,300 total votes for Obama — still short of the 685,000 Mississippi votes that went to George W. Bush in 2004.


In sum, he falls short by more than 150,000 votes in Mississippi, about 300,000 votes in Georgia and more than 200,000 votes in South Carolina - even using the most favorable estimates.


We did the same analysis on the rest of the Southern states. The math works out the same everywhere but in Florida, where the margin between the parties is so close that an extra 400,000 black voters — all supporting Obama — might buy him a very narrow victory."

And he was instrumental in securing the funding to have the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers get the work done.

It also is true that building the first strong fence along the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego in the early 1990s, and strengthening it at the end of the decade, did coincide with a sharp drop in apprehension of illegal immigrants in the westernmost area of the U.S.-Mexico border. But analysts dispute to what extent these changes can be attributed to the border fence.


Hunter is correct that smuggling along the San Diego-Tijuana corridor dramatically decreased when the fence started to go up. Border Patrol apprehensions at the Imperial Beach station, the most secure point along the fence, dropped from 321,560 in 1993 to 19,035 in 2004, a decrease of 94 percent over the 12-year period.


But apprehensions along the entire San Diego County section of the border, which does not have a continuous secure fence, dropped sharply, too -- 79 percent between 1996 and 2002. Meanwhile, apprehensions in the neighboring fenceless El Centro County shot up during the same period.


The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the federal government, notes that opponents of the fence say there is no way of measuring how many smugglers go through the area without being apprehended. CRS says those same critics also point to other factors, such as a doubling of the number of border patrol agents in the same period that might have deterred illegal crossings.


Hunter is also mostly correct about his pivotal role in the construction of both the first fence along the 14-mile stretch between San Diego and Tijuana (begun in 1990) and the subsequent strengthening of the fence. He snagged the funding for the first fence in the early 1990s, then wrote the law authorizing funding for two additional layers in 1996."

This is a case of taking good statistics and using them to reach a false conclusion.


Giuliani rightfully boasts about significant drops in crime rates during his tenure as mayor. The raw percentages are eye-popping, but they also mirror a trend that could be seen nationally and in cities around the country.


In this statement, Giuliani simply tries to say too much. His assertion that the national decline in crime ""would be fairly small"" if not for the improvements in New York just isn't true.


From 1993-2001 -- the time frame the Giuliani campaign uses for its crime stats -- the number of violent crimes nationwide fell by about 25 percent. If you factor out the crimes that occurred in New York during that same period, the nationwide drop would still have been 23 percent.

In fact, she made that point in the original speech, as well as in Wednesday's statement.


On Monday, Clinton made headlines when she told the annual meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Kansas City that, ""We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas, particularly in al Anbar province, it's working.""


But she also told the VFW she didn't believe the conflict in Iraq could be solved militarily, or that U.S. troops should be policing a civil war. ""The best way of honoring their service is by beginning to bring them home,"" she said. McCain's statement does not mention that part of her speech.


On Aug. 22, Clinton's Senate office issued a statement saying she hasn't changed her position: ""The surge was designed to give the Iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution to the situation. It has failed to do so…. It is abundantly clear that there is no military solution to the sectarian fighting in Iraq. We need to stop refereeing the war, and start getting out now.""


Indeed, Clinton introduced legislation in February in the Senate, S. 670, to withdraw troops from Iraq.

The American public has spoken with one voice, and they're saying that this is not right.""


McCain is correct that the ruling in

Kelo vs. New London, Conn.

, a 2005 Supreme Court decision allowing local governments to take land from property owners for the purpose of economic development, is unpopular in the United States. But some of the numbers he uses to illustrate his point are unreliable and inflated.


McCain's numbers are gleaned from a list put together by the Castle Coalition, an activist group launched to fight eminent domain seizures in the wake of the

Kelo

decision.


Of the numbers he cites, only the Ohio figure comes from a scientific and disinterested poll. The rest of the numbers are from surveys commissioned by interest groups, or from unscientific polls conducted by local news organizations on their Web sites.


McCain did not ignore more reliable polls, he just didn't have them. There has been little, if any, national polling on eminent domain since the

Kelo

decision. A Gallup poll conducted immediately after the

Kelo

decision found that the ruling contributed to a plunge in Americans' approval of the Supreme Court.


And in 2006, 12 states considered ballot initiatives on legislation limiting eminent domain power. Ten of those measures became law, most with more than 60 percent of the vote: Louisiana (55%), Nevada (63%), Arizona (65%), Oregon (67%), North Dakota (68%), Florida (69%), Michigan (80%), Georgia (83%), New Hampshire (86%) and South Carolina (86%).

He sets up the claim, saying: ""When a National Guard soldier would fall in combat, the family was only getting $12,000 — a national disgrace.""

He says 18 states followed his lead.


We find the claims to be mostly true, though the nitpicker in us needs to point out that no governor can ""pass"" a law without a big assist from the legislative branch. Also, the ad overstates a couple of points.


Let's focus on the set-up claim first.


At the time in question — early 2005 — the families of fallen service personnel received a $12,420 ""death gratuity"" or benefit. What the ad does not say is that they probably also received the benefit of a low-cost, government-subsidized life insurance policy covering the soldiers for up to $250,000. About 95 percent of ready reserves purchase this insurance. In fact, it's automatically deducted from their pay unless they opt out.


This overstatement aside, Richardson did initiate and push through legislation to pay the premiums on those policies for members of the New Mexico National Guard. The legislation does amount to ""giving"" soldiers life insurance, as the ad states.


After Congress upped the maximum payout to $400,000, New Mexico agreed to cover the additional premiums for that coverage.


The $12,420 death benefit, which many others described as disgraceful, was increased to $100,000 by Congress at the same time.


Later in 2005 and 2006, the 18 states mentioned in the ad did pass some form of legislation improving benefits for military personnel. Were they all following Richardson's lead as the ad suggests?
Richardson said in a February 2005 news release that 21 states had contacted his office about the insurance program. ""Many are preparing legislation based on the New Mexico model,"" he said.
Still, he is far from being a lone voice on the issue.


Only a few months earlier, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was proposing a generous bump in military death benefits during his 2004 presidential run. By mid January 2005, President Bush and many members of Congress from both parties were clamoring to increase death benefits for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.


We note that Richardson first proposed paying for the premiums to his state's National Guard troops on Jan. 4, 2005. So he does appear to have been on the leading edge of the effort."

""Ironically, all of this comes at a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally,"" Thompson wrote. He went on to cite National Rifle Association figures.


His statistics fall short in several ways.


First, gun ownership rates are extremely difficult to calculate. The NRA used 8-year-old federal estimates and then used gun purchase figures to assume there are additional guns in the United States. However, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said it is impossible to estimate how gun ownership has grown because there is no national gun registry.


Violent crime had been at historic lows, dropping between 1993 and 2004. However, the FBI reports that the estimated rate of violent crime increased 2.3 percent in 2005 and 1.3 percent in 2006.


Advocates on both sides of the issue have used the statistics to argue their own cases.

Wade, but when the San Francisco Chronicle and CNN asked him about it in late 1999, McCain said, ""I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations.""

McCain aides almost immediately started backpedaling from McCain's words, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase ""even in the long term."" McCain said in an interview a few months later, ""I clearly misspoke there. I'm a person who's made mistakes in this campaign, and I'll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts.""


In South Carolina this year, McCain said, ""I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.""

""...study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really dramatic effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring as many as 18 or more murders. That's according to Emory University professors, who found as well that delaying execution also leads to further murders. Most studies have concluded that some number of murders between three and 18 are prevented for every application of capital punishment.""


A dozen research papers in the last six years support Thompson's assertion that capital punishment prevents murders, according to the Associated Press. Three studies get the most attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 from the Emory researchers.


The Law & Order star accurately quotes the Emory study, but his generalizations about ""most studies"" ignore significant contrary research.


A handful of studies directly challenge pro-deterrence findings by highlighting various missteps in methodology. ""These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios,"" said Jeffery Fagan of the Columbia Law School during testimony before a New York legislative panel.

But his anti-lobbyist policy includes one caveat and a few loopholes that weaken his claim to be funding his political campaign in a way that's truly different from his competitors.


He almost always qualifies his statement to note that he won't take money from federal lobbyists, a distinction that allows him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists.


For example, South Florida lobbyist Russ Klenet and his wife will host a fundraising event in Broward County for Obama on August 25. Klenet represents state groups such as the Florida Association of Mortgage Brokers, but also companies such as Match.com and Election Systems & Software.


And Obama still accepts tens of thousands of dollars from people who work for Washington firms that do substantial lobbying. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is an Obama contributor who isn't a registered lobbyist, but works as a consultant for Alston & Bird, a lobbying firm in Washington.


The Center for Responsive Politics found that Obama accepted $55,019 from employees at lobbying firms, and much more from companies that are not classified as lobbying firms but have lobbying divisions.


So we give Obama's statement a Half-True on the Truth-O-Meter. While Obama can accurately say that he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, he still accepts thousands from people in the influence industry."

Biden's assertions are based on information from the Department of Defense. In testimony and reports, military officials have said roadside bombs – improvised explosive devices – have caused 70 percent of U.S. casualties.


The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, told the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a March 2007 letter the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, called MRAPs, ""could reduce the casualties in vehicles due to IED attack by as much as 80 percent."" Those estimates are based on damages sustained mostly by Humvees, which are commonly used for quick transport but offer little protection from bombs.

The trouble with the 80 percent figure is that things are changing rapidly in Iraq. In the past year, military officials have reported that Iraqi insurgents have been using bombs that can pierce the armor of the MRAPs. The stronger bombs have been used in fewer numbers, and it's uncertain how much insurgents will target the new trucks with them, said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org."

But it doesn't really matter, especially since so many in the Democratic field of candidates are in the Senate or the House. Either way, Giuliani is correct that Democrats are open to letting some of the tax cuts of 2001 expire, which would raise taxes for those affected.


Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they want to renew some of the those tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. But they also have indicated that they would favor allowing tax cuts to expire that, in their view, unfairly benefit wealthy Americans. The tax rate on household incomes above $200,000 would return to higher levels, as would taxes on capital gains, dividends and estates.


But is that a 20 to 30 percent increase?


To defend his claim, the Giuliani campaign points to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows a 31 percent rise in revenue from 2006 to 2011 if all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire.


There are two problems with this. First of all, the Democrats aren't advocating the elimination of

all

of the 2001 tax cuts. And second, the logic of the Giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase.


If that's the standard, than President Bush's own budget for 2008, released in February, includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too.

Still, Peach said Richardson's tax incentives and income tax cuts have created a favorable atmosphere for business that is a stark change from the state's mentality in the mid-1970s, when state officials refused to provide help to a promising young company named Microsoft.

He relies on an extremely optimistic (and possibly unrealistic) notion that the U.S. fleet would average 40-45 mpg at some point in the near future. He does not specify whether he means 40-45 mpg in the equivalent of today's tests (which would mean on-road performance much lower) or if he means on-road. Since he used the testing standard before, we'll assume the same here, which would equate to 35 mpg in the real world. At 35 mpg, Schipper estimates fuel usage could be reduced by about 40 percent.


Instead of simply saying it would reduce fuel use by 40 percent, Obama shrewdly plays on the belief by many Americans that the U.S. is heavily dependent on Mideast oil.


""Contrary to popular belief, we don't import a lot of oil from the Middle East,"" said
said John DeCicco, a senior fellow for automotive strategies with the advocacy group Environmental Defense.


In fact, the U.S. gets less than 20 percent of its imported oil from the Mideast, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. gets almost twice as much oil from Canada than it gets from Saudi Arabia.


Obama is correct that a reduction in oil demand because of more fuel efficient cars could theoretically eliminate the need to import any oil from the Mideast. But he ignores the reality of global petroleum markets. ""It's not correct to say that we can specify where we buy our oil,"" Schipper said. ""Oil goes into one big world barrel.""


Obama's comment ""if we import zero oil from the Middle East, that means the gas prices are going to go down at the pump"" is a bit of a stretch. Given the volatility of oil prices and the time it, the price at the pump might still go up because of other factors. But under his scenario, it would go up less."

""While our fuel standards haven't moved from 27.5 miles per gallon in two decades, both China and Japan have surpassed us, with Japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon.""

Obama's claim about Japanese cars getting more than 45 mpg involves the fuzzy science of measuring fuel economy, complicated by differing standards in each nation. Obama's campaign says his number comes from a 2004 study by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change that calculated Japanese cars would get 46 mpg if Japan followed the same test methods as the U.S. (Obama accurately says the U.S. mandate has been 27.5 for 20 years.)


Obama's claim is technically correct. But the Pew numbers exaggerate the differences between the countries because those estimates do not reflect real-world conditions, according to Lee Schipper, director of research at the World Resources Institute's Center for Transport and Environment.


He says the Japanese fleet actually averages about 23 mpg on the road today, but is improving. The U.S. number is only slightly lower, about 21, but has been stagnant. The real-world numbers are closer because, despite more fuel-efficient cars in Japan, heavy traffic congestion erases much of the efficiency.


Schipper said Obama ""is correct that Japan's fuel efficiency is higher and improving more rapidly, but his number is inaccurate. The number he used doesn't really represent a realistic on-road achievement.""


Yet Schipper said he doesn't fault Obama for the confusion. ""Everybody makes this mistake. What matters is what cars really get on the road, how long it takes to change the entire fleet and how much people drive."" (Japanese drivers drive about one-third as many miles per year as U.S. drivers.)"
