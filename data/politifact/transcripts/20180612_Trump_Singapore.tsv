1	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much, everybody.	0
2	Donald Trump	We appreciate it.	0
3	Donald Trump	We're getting ready to go back.	0
4	Donald Trump	We had a tremendous 24 hours.	0
5	Donald Trump	We've had a tremendous three months, actually, because this has been going on for quite a while.	0
6	Donald Trump	That was a tape that we gave to Chairman Kim and his people, his representatives.	0
7	Donald Trump	And it captures a lot.	0
8	Donald Trump	It captures what could be done.	0
9	Donald Trump	And that's a great -- a great place.	0
10	Donald Trump	It has the potential to be an incredible place.	0
11	Donald Trump	Between South Korea -- if you think about it -- and China, it's got tremendous potential.	0
12	Donald Trump	And I think he understands that and he wants to do what's right.	0
13	Donald Trump	It's my honor today to address the people of the world, following this very historic summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea.	0
14	Donald Trump	We spent very intensive hours together, and I think most of you have gotten the signed document, or you will very shortly.	0
15	Donald Trump	It's very comprehensive.	0
16	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.	0
17	Donald Trump	I stand before you as an emissary of the American people to deliver a message of hope and vision, and a message of peace.	0
18	Donald Trump	Let me begin by thanking our incredible hosts in Singapore, especially Prime Minister Lee, a friend of mine.	0
19	Donald Trump	This is a country of profound grace and beauty, and we send our warmest wishes to every citizen of Singapore, who really made this visit so important and so pleasant, despite all of the work and all of the long hours.	0
20	Donald Trump	I also want to thank President Moon of South Korea.	0
21	Donald Trump	He's working hard.	0
22	Donald Trump	In fact, I'll be speaking to him right after we're finished.	0
23	Donald Trump	Prime Minister Abe of Japan -- a friend of mine -- just left our country, and he wants what's right for Japan and for the world.	0
24	Donald Trump	He's a good man.	0
25	Donald Trump	And a very special person, President Xi of China, who has really closed up that border -- maybe a little bit less so over the last couple of months, but that's okay.	0
26	Donald Trump	But he really has.	0
27	Donald Trump	And he's a terrific person and a friend of mine, and really a great leader of his people.	0
28	Donald Trump	I want to thank them for their efforts to help us get to this very historic day.	0
29	Donald Trump	Most importantly, I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people.	0
30	Donald Trump	Our unprecedented meeting -- the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea -- proves that real change is indeed possible.	0
31	Donald Trump	My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct, and productive.	0
32	Donald Trump	We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time, under very strong, strong circumstance.	0
33	Donald Trump	We're prepared to start a new history and we're ready to write a new chapter between our nations.	0
34	Donald Trump	Nearly 70 years ago -- think of that; 70 years ago -- an extremely bloody conflict ravaged the Korean Peninsula.	0
35	Donald Trump	Countless people died in the conflict, including tens of thousands of brave Americans.	0
36	Donald Trump	Yet, while the armistice was agreed to, the war never ended.	0
37	Donald Trump	To this day, never ended.	0
38	Donald Trump	But now we can all have hope that it will soon end.	0
39	Donald Trump	And it will.	0
40	Donald Trump	It will soon end.	0
41	Donald Trump	The past does not have to define the future.	0
42	Donald Trump	Yesterday's conflict does not have to be tomorrow's war.	0
43	Donald Trump	And as history has proven over and over again, adversaries can indeed become friends.	0
44	Donald Trump	We can honor the sacrifice of our forefathers by replacing the horrors of battle with the blessings of peace.	0
45	Donald Trump	And that's what we're doing and that's what we have done.	0
46	Donald Trump	There is no limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce and engagement with the rest of the world -- that really wants to engage.	0
47	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim has before him an opportunity like no other: to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people.	0
48	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his "unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."	0
49	Donald Trump	We also agreed to vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible.	0
50	Donald Trump	And he wants to do that.	0
51	Donald Trump	This isn't the past.	0
52	Donald Trump	This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done.	0
53	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim has told me that North Korea is already destroying a major missile engine testing site.	0
54	Donald Trump	That's not in your signed document; we agreed to that after the agreement was signed.	0
55	Donald Trump	That's a big thing -- for the missiles that they were testing, the site is going to be destroyed very soon.	0
56	Donald Trump	Today is the beginning of an arduous process.	0
57	Donald Trump	Our eyes are wide open, but peace is always worth the effort, especially in this case.	0
58	Donald Trump	This should have been done years ago.	0
59	Donald Trump	This should have been resolved a long time ago, but we're resolving it now.	0
60	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim has the chance to seize an incredible future for his people.	0
61	Donald Trump	Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace.	0
62	Donald Trump	The current state of affairs cannot endure forever.	0
63	Donald Trump	The people of Korea -- North and South -- are profoundly talented, industrious, and gifted.	0
64	Donald Trump	These are truly gifted people.	0
65	Donald Trump	They share the same heritage, language, customs, culture, and destiny.	0
66	Donald Trump	But to realize their amazing destiny, to reunite their national family, the menace of nuclear weapons will now be removed.	0
67	Donald Trump	In the meantime, the sanctions will remain in effect.	0
68	Donald Trump	We dream of a future where all Koreans can live together in harmony, where families are reunited and hopes are reborn, and where the light of peace chases away the darkness of war.	0
69	Donald Trump	This bright future is within -- and this is what's happening.	0
70	Donald Trump	It is right there.	0
71	Donald Trump	It's within our reach.	0
72	Donald Trump	It's going to be there.	0
73	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.	0
74	Donald Trump	People thought this could never take place.	0
75	Donald Trump	It is now taking place.	0
76	Donald Trump	It's a very great day.	0
77	Donald Trump	It's a very great moment in the history of the world.	0
78	Donald Trump	And Chairman Kim is on his way back to North Korea.	0
79	Donald Trump	And I know for a fact, as soon as he arrives, he's going to start a process that's going to make a lot of people very happy and very safe.	0
80	Donald Trump	So it's an honor to be with everybody today.	0
81	Donald Trump	The media -- this is a big gathering of media, I will say.	0
82	Donald Trump	It makes me feel very uncomfortable.	0
83	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
84	Donald Trump	But it is what it is.	0
85	Donald Trump	People understand that this is something very important to all of us, including yourselves and your families.	0
86	Donald Trump	So thank you very much for being here.	0
87	Donald Trump	We'll take some questions.	0
88	Donald Trump	Wow.	0
89	Donald Trump	That's a lot of questions.	0
90	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
91	Donald Trump	Sure, go ahead.	0
92	Donald Trump	NBC.	0
93	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
94	Question	Two questions for you, if you don't mind.	0
95	Question	First, the man you met today, Kim Jong Un, as you know, has killed family members, has starved his own people, is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier.	0
96	Question	Why are you so comfortable calling him "very talented"?	0
97	Donald Trump	Well, he is very talented.	0
98	Donald Trump	Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough -- I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it -- he ran it.	0
99	Donald Trump	Very few people, at that age -- you can take one out of ten thousand, probably, couldn't do it.	0
100	Donald Trump	Otto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life.	0
101	Donald Trump	His parents are good friends of mine.	0
102	Donald Trump	I think, without Otto, this would not have happened.	0
103	Donald Trump	Something happened, from that day.	0
104	Donald Trump	It was a terrible thing.	0
105	Donald Trump	It was brutal.	0
106	Donald Trump	But a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea.	0
107	Donald Trump	I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain.	0
108	Donald Trump	I told this to his parents.	0
109	Donald Trump	Special young man.	0
110	Donald Trump	And I have to say, special parents, special people.	0
111	Donald Trump	Otto did not die in vain.	0
112	Donald Trump	He had a lot to do with us being here today.	0
113	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
114	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
115	Question	Mr. President, that second question for you, sir, was on the security -- the second question, sir --	0
116	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
117	Question	-- on the security assurances you talked about in your statement.	0
118	Question	Can you be specific about what assurances you are willing to give to Kim Jong Un?	0
119	Question	Does that include reducing military capabilities?	0
120	Donald Trump	No.	0
121	Question	And just to follow up on your answer --	0
122	Donald Trump	No, we're not reducing anything.	0
123	Donald Trump	We're not reducing.	0
124	Donald Trump	At some point, I have to be honest -- and I used to say this during my campaign, as you know, probably, better than most -- I want to get our soldiers out.	0
125	Donald Trump	I want to bring our soldiers back home.	0
126	Donald Trump	We have, right now, 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, and I'd like to be able to bring them back home.	0
127	Donald Trump	But that's not part of the equation right now.	0
128	Donald Trump	At some point, I hope it will be, but not right now.	0
129	Donald Trump	We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should.	0
130	Donald Trump	But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money.	0
131	Donald Trump	Plus, I think it's very provocative.	0
132	Donald Trump	Yes, John.	0
133	Donald Trump	Yes, John, go ahead.	0
134	Donald Trump	Oh, go ahead.	0
135	Donald Trump	I'm sorry, I thought you were John Roberts.	0
136	Donald Trump	I looked at you, you just like --	0
137	Question	It's all right.	0
138	Donald Trump	Much better, right?	0
139	Question	Frequently -- we're frequently confused, Mr. President.	0
140	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
141	Question	Mr. President, this joint statement does not talk about verifiable or irreversible denuclearization.	0
142	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
143	Question	Was that a concession on the part of the United States?	0
144	Donald Trump	No, not at all.	0
145	Donald Trump	Because if you look at it, I mean, it said we are going to -- let's see here -- it will be gone.	0
146	Donald Trump	I don't think you can be anymore plain than what we're asking -- "issues related to the establishment of the new U.S. DPRK relations" -- the building.	0
147	Donald Trump	We talk about the guarantees, and we talk about "unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."	0
148	Donald Trump	This is the document that we just signed.	0
149	Question	Did you discuss with Chairman Kim methods to verify, either with the United States or international organizations, that very process?	0
150	Question	And do you have a timetable --	0
151	Donald Trump	Yes, we did.	0
152	Donald Trump	Yes, we did.	0
153	Donald Trump	And we'll be verifying.	0
154	Question	Can you give that to us?	0
155	Donald Trump	Yeah, we'll be verifying.	0
156	Donald Trump	It will be verified.	0
157	Question	How is that going to be achieved, Mr. President?	0
158	Donald Trump	Well, it's going to be achieved by having a lot of people there, and as we develop a certain trust.	0
159	Donald Trump	And we think we have done that.	0
160	Donald Trump	Secretary Pompeo has been really doing a fantastic job -- his staff, everybody.	0
161	Donald Trump	As we do that, we're going to have a lot of people there, and we're going to be working with them on a lot of other things.	0
162	Donald Trump	But this is complete denuclearization of North Korea, and it will be verified.	0
163	Question	Will those people be Americans or international --	0
164	Donald Trump	Uh, combinations of both.	0
165	Donald Trump	Combinations of both.	0
166	Donald Trump	And we have talked about it, yes.	0
167	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.	0
168	Donald Trump	Be nice.	0
169	Donald Trump	Be respectful.	0
170	Question	I'll be very respectful, sir.	0
171	Question	What did Kim Jong Un say to you to give you the confidence that, for once in the history of North Korea, they are not cheating the system, and gaming the world, and gaming the people who will have to go in and make sure that they're actually giving up their nuclear arsenal?	0
172	Question	What did he say to you?	0
173	Donald Trump	Yeah, I mean, very fair question.	0
174	Donald Trump	He actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past, and, ultimately, as you know, nothing got done.	0
175	Donald Trump	In one case, they took billions of dollars -- during the Clinton regime -- took billions of dollars and nothing happened.	0
176	Donald Trump	That was a terrible thing, and he actually brought it up to me.	0
177	Donald Trump	And he said we have never gone this far.	0
178	Donald Trump	I don't think they've ever had the confidence, frankly, in a President that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done.	0
179	Donald Trump	And he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this.	0
180	Donald Trump	I think he might want to do this as much or even more than me because they see a very bright future for North Korea.	0
181	Donald Trump	So you never know.	0
182	Donald Trump	Right?	0
183	Donald Trump	We never know.	0
184	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what, we signed a very comprehensive document today, and I think most of you have been given that document.	0
185	Donald Trump	But we signed a very, very comprehensive document, and I believe he's going to live up to that document.	0
186	Donald Trump	In fact, when he lands -- which is going to be shortly -- I think that he will start that process right away.	0
187	Question	Do you trust him, Mr. President?	0
188	Donald Trump	I do.	0
189	Donald Trump	I do.	0
190	Donald Trump	I can only say that I know him for -- really well, it's been very rhetorical, as you know.	0
191	Donald Trump	I think, without the rhetoric, it wouldn't have happened.	0
192	Donald Trump	I think without other things going along -- I think the establishment of a new team was very important.	0
193	Donald Trump	We have a great team.	0
194	Donald Trump	But I do, I think he wants to get it done.	0
195	Donald Trump	I really feel that very strongly.	0
196	Donald Trump	Oh, there's John.	0
197	Donald Trump	I think -- you know, you two guys look alike when the light is right on the -- the hair is very similar.	0
198	Donald Trump	Let me see, who has better hair?	0
199	Donald Trump	He's got pretty good hair, John, I hate to --	0
200	Question	It's the angelic glow of the backlighting, Mr. President, that makes us look so similar.	0
201	Question	Of course, the denuclearization -- nuclear weapons and biological weapons and whatnot -- is one problem in North Korea.	0
202	Question	Another huge problem is the horrible record that they have on human rights.	0
203	Question	Was that discussed at all?	0
204	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
205	Question	Is that something that you will tackle in the future?	0
206	Donald Trump	Yes, it was discussed.	0
207	Donald Trump	It will be discussed more in the future -- human rights.	0
208	Donald Trump	What was also discussed in great detail, John, was that fact that, you know, we have -- and I must have had just countless calls and letters and tweets, anything you can do -- they want the remains of their sons back.	0
209	Donald Trump	They want the remains of their fathers, and mothers, and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea.	0
210	Donald Trump	And I asked for it today, and we got it.	0
211	Donald Trump	That was a very last minute.	0
212	Donald Trump	The remains will be coming back.	0
213	Donald Trump	They're going to start that process immediately.	0
214	Donald Trump	But so many people, even during the campaign, they'd say, "Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back or my father back?"	0
215	Donald Trump	So many people asked me this question.	0
216	Donald Trump	And, you know, I said, "Look, we don't get along too well with that particular group of people."	0
217	Donald Trump	But now we do.	0
218	Donald Trump	And he agreed to that so quickly and so nice -- it was really a very nice thing, and he understands it.	0
219	Donald Trump	He understands it.	0
220	Donald Trump	So for the thousands and thousands -- I guess way over 6,000 that we know of, in terms of the remains, they'll be brought back.	0
221	Question	The POW-MIA issue clearly is a very important one for thousands of Americans.	0
222	Donald Trump	Especially to a lot of people that are --	0
223	Question	But what do you, President Trump, expect Kim Jong Un to do about the human rights record regarding the North Korean people?	0
224	Donald Trump	Right.	0
225	Donald Trump	It was discussed.	0
226	Donald Trump	It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization.	0
227	Donald Trump	Well, obviously, that's where we started and where we ended.	0
228	Donald Trump	But they will be doing things, and I think he wants to do things.	0
229	Donald Trump	I think he wants to -- you'd be very surprised.	0
230	Donald Trump	Very smart.	0
231	Donald Trump	Very good negotiator.	0
232	Donald Trump	Wants to do the right thing.	0
233	Donald Trump	You know, he brought up the fact that, in the past, they took dialogue far -- they never went -- they never were like we are.	0
234	Donald Trump	There's never been anything like what's taken place now.	0
235	Donald Trump	But they went down the line.	0
236	Donald Trump	Billions of dollars were given, and you know, the following day the nuclear program continued.	0
237	Donald Trump	But this is a much different time, and this is a much different President, in all fairness.	0
238	Donald Trump	This is very important to me.	0
239	Donald Trump	This is one of the -- perhaps, one of the reasons that I -- one, I campaigned on this issue, as you know very well, John.	0
240	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
241	Donald Trump	Whoever those people are.	0
242	Donald Trump	I cannot see you with all the lights, but you don't look like either of the two.	0
243	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.	0
244	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
245	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
246	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
247	Question	And first of all, congratulations.	0
248	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
249	Donald Trump	Appreciate it.	0
250	Question	Can you touch on the issue of a peace treaty?	0
251	Question	And also, will you travel to Pyongyang anytime soon?	0
252	Donald Trump	Well, at a certain time, I will.	0
253	Donald Trump	I said that will be a day that I look very much forward to, at the appropriate time.	0
254	Donald Trump	And I also will be inviting Chairman Kim, at the appropriate time, to the White House.	0
255	Donald Trump	I think it's really going to be something that will be very important.	0
256	Donald Trump	And he has accepted.	0
257	Donald Trump	I said, at the appropriate time.	0
258	Donald Trump	We want to go a little bit further down the road.	0
259	Donald Trump	But what we signed today was a lot of things included.	0
260	Donald Trump	And then you have things that weren't included that we got after the deal was signed.	0
261	Donald Trump	I've done that before in my life.	0
262	Donald Trump	We didn't put it in the agreement because we didn't have time.	0
263	Donald Trump	And I think most of you have been handed out the agreement or soon will.	0
264	Donald Trump	But I --	0
265	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
266	Donald Trump	Oh, you have not?	0
267	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
268	Donald Trump	Well, if you could have those agreements passed out.	0
269	Donald Trump	We just finished them, just a little while ago.	0
270	Donald Trump	But if you could have the agreements passed out, we'll -- you'll see what we're talking about.	0
271	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.	0
272	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
273	Question	I will second the congratulations, President.	0
274	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
275	Question	What part did Japan play?	0
276	Question	And did the abduction issue come up?	0
277	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
278	Question	And also, the fate of the Christians?	0
279	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
280	Question	And the follow-up question is when will you be doing an interview with Japanese TV?	0
281	Question	Fifty-thousand American troops are in Japan.	0
282	Question	Congratulations, again.	0
283	Donald Trump	That's true.	0
284	Donald Trump	Fifty-thousand great troops.	0
285	Donald Trump	That's true.	0
286	Donald Trump	Yeah, it did -- abduction.	0
287	Donald Trump	Absolutely.	0
288	Donald Trump	This is Prime Minister Abe's -- one of his, certainly -- other than the whole denuking subject -- certainly his, I would say, his main point.	0
289	Donald Trump	And I brought it up.	0
290	Donald Trump	Absolutely.	0
291	Donald Trump	And they're going to be working on that.	0
292	Donald Trump	It will be -- we didn't put it down in the document, but it will be worked on.	0
293	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
294	Donald Trump	Christians, yes.	0
295	Donald Trump	We are -- brought it up very strongly.	0
296	Donald Trump	You know, Franklin Graham spent -- spent and spends a tremendous amount of time in North Korea.	0
297	Donald Trump	He's got it very close to his heart.	0
298	Donald Trump	It did come up, and things will be happening.	0
299	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
300	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
301	Donald Trump	Great question.	0
302	Donald Trump	Yes, Jon.	0
303	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
304	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
305	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jon.	0
306	Question	Returning to the question of human rights, you spoke very powerfully on the issue during your State of the Union Address.	0
307	Question	You showed that -- you had the defector in the First Lady's box with the crutches, who escaped.	0
308	Question	And you, at that point, said that North Korea has more brutally oppressed its people than any other regime on Earth.	0
309	Question	Do you still believe that is the case having sat down with Kim Jong Un?	0
310	Question	And does he need to change that?	0
311	Donald Trump	Right.	0
312	Donald Trump	Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there.	0
313	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.	0
314	Donald Trump	And we did discuss it today pretty strongly.	0
315	Donald Trump	I mean, knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is: denuking.	0
316	Donald Trump	But discussed it at pretty good length.	0
317	Donald Trump	We'll be doing something on it.	0
318	Donald Trump	It's rough.	0
319	Donald Trump	It's rough in a lot of places, by the way.	0
320	Donald Trump	Not just there.	0
321	Donald Trump	But it's rough, and we will continue that.	0
322	Donald Trump	And I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.	0
323	Donald Trump	But it was discussed at length outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.	0
324	Question	But do you think that needs to change to bring on this glorious new era you've talked about?	0
325	Question	Are they going to have to --	0
326	Donald Trump	I think it will change.	0
327	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
328	Donald Trump	I think it probably has to, but I think it will.	0
329	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
330	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
331	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
332	Donald Trump	Steve.	0
333	Donald Trump	That's you, Steve?	0
334	Donald Trump	Right there.	0
335	Question	Yes, sir.	0
336	Question	Thank you.	0
337	Question	What timetable do you envision for their denuclearization?	0
338	Question	And in the meantime, are you thinking about easing any sanctions?	0
339	Donald Trump	Well, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization.	0
340	Donald Trump	It takes a long time.	0
341	Donald Trump	Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen.	0
342	Donald Trump	But…	0
343	Donald Trump	Having sat down with Kim Jong Un.	0
344	Donald Trump	And does he have to change that?	0
345	Donald Trump	Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there.	0
346	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.	0
347	Donald Trump	And we did discuss it today pretty strongly.	0
348	Donald Trump	I mean, knowing what -- the main purpose of what we were doing is: denuking.	0
349	Donald Trump	But discussed at pretty good length.	0
350	Donald Trump	We'll be doing something on it.	0
351	Donald Trump	It's rough.	0
352	Donald Trump	It's rough in a lot of places, by the way -- not just there.	0
353	Donald Trump	But it's rough.	0
354	Donald Trump	And we will continue that, and I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.	0
355	Donald Trump	But it was discussed at length.	0
356	Donald Trump	Outside of -- outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.	0
357	Question	But do you think that needs to change to bring on this glorious new era you've talked about?	0
358	Question	Are they going to have to --	0
359	Donald Trump	I think it will change, yeah.	0
360	Donald Trump	I think it probably has to.	0
361	Donald Trump	But I think it will.	0
362	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
363	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
364	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
365	Donald Trump	Steve?	0
366	Donald Trump	That's you, Steve?	0
367	Donald Trump	Right there.	0
368	Question	Yes, sir.	0
369	Question	Thank you.	0
370	Question	What timetable do you envision for their denuclearization?	0
371	Question	And in the meantime, are you thinking about easing any sanctions?	0
372	Donald Trump	Well, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization.	0
373	Donald Trump	It takes a long time.	0
374	Donald Trump	Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen.	0
375	Donald Trump	But despite that, once you start the process, it means it's pretty much over; you can't use them.	0
376	Donald Trump	That's the good news.	0
377	Donald Trump	And that's going to start very -- very soon.	0
378	Donald Trump	I believe that's going to start very soon.	0
379	Donald Trump	We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done, Steve.	0
380	Question	And the sanctions?	0
381	Donald Trump	The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor.	0
382	Donald Trump	Sanctions played a big role, but they'll come off at that point.	0
383	Donald Trump	I hope it's going to be soon, but they'll come off.	0
384	Donald Trump	As you know, and as I've said, the sanctions right now remain.	0
385	Donald Trump	But at a certain point, I actually look forward to taking them off.	0
386	Donald Trump	And they'll come off when we know we're down the road -- where it's not going to happen, nothing is going to happen.	0
387	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
388	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.	0
389	Donald Trump	Please.	0
390	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
391	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
392	Question	Congratulations on this historic summit.	0
393	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
394	Donald Trump	Congratulations to everybody, by the way.	0
395	Donald Trump	Congratulations to everybody.	0
396	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
397	Question	You signed a document with Kim Jong Un.	0
398	Question	It's essentially a piece of paper.	0
399	Question	Yesterday, we had a briefing from the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.	0
400	Question	He said the following: "Many Presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper only to find that the North Koreans either didn't promise what we thought they had, or actually reneged on those promises."	0
401	Question	What makes this time different, Mr. President?	0
402	Donald Trump	Well, you have a different administration.	0
403	Donald Trump	You have a different President.	0
404	Donald Trump	You have a different Secretary of State.	0
405	Donald Trump	You have people that are -- you know, it's very important to them.	0
406	Donald Trump	And we get it done.	0
407	Donald Trump	The other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority.	0
408	Donald Trump	I don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly.	0
409	Donald Trump	I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority.	0
410	Donald Trump	And it would have been easier back then.	0
411	Donald Trump	It would have been -- for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago.	0
412	Donald Trump	And I'm not just blaming President Obama.	0
413	Donald Trump	I mean, this goes back -- for 25 years, this should have happened.	0
414	Donald Trump	I was given a very tough hand.	0
415	Donald Trump	I was given this, I was given the Iran deal, and plenty of other problems.	0
416	Donald Trump	But we are -- we're doing really well.	0
417	Donald Trump	And the Iran deal, I have to be honest, I did it because nuclear is always number one to me.	0
418	Donald Trump	Nuclear is number one.	0
419	Donald Trump	But on the Iran deal, I think Iran is a different country now than it was three or four months ago.	0
420	Donald Trump	I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean.	0
421	Donald Trump	I don't think they're looking so much at Syria, like they were, with total confidence.	0
422	Donald Trump	I don't think they're so confident right now.	0
423	Donald Trump	But I hope -- with that being said, I hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in -- and they are brutal, what we've put on Iran -- I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because I'd love to be able to do that.	0
424	Donald Trump	But right now, it's too soon for that.	0
425	Donald Trump	Yes, please.	0
426	Question	Mr. President, you also didn't talk about establishing diplomatic relations, exchanging ambassadors.	0
427	Question	How long before that happens?	0
428	Donald Trump	Good question.	0
429	Donald Trump	Hopefully soon.	0
430	Donald Trump	But we'll have to get things moving first.	0
431	Donald Trump	Very -- a little bit early for that.	0
432	Donald Trump	We have to get things moving.	0
433	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.	0
434	Donald Trump	Hi.	0
435	Question	Can you clarify, when you said you were stopping "war games," so you are stopping the military exercises with South Korea?	0
436	Donald Trump	Yeah, we've done exercises for a long period of time, working with South Korea.	1
437	Donald Trump	And we call them "war games," and I call them "war games."	0
438	Donald Trump	And they're tremendously expensive.	1
439	Donald Trump	The amount of money that we spend on that is incredible.	0
440	Donald Trump	And South Korea contributes, but not 100 percent, which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also.	0
441	Donald Trump	And that has to do with the military expense and also the trade.	0
442	Donald Trump	So we're doing that.	0
443	Donald Trump	We actually have a new deal with South Korea, in terms of the trade deal, but we have to talk to them.	0
444	Donald Trump	We have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly.	0
445	Donald Trump	But the war games are very expensive.	0
446	Donald Trump	We pay for a big majority of them.	0
447	Donald Trump	We fly in bombers from Guam.	0
448	Donald Trump	I said -- when I first started, I said, "Where do the bombers come from?"	0
449	Donald Trump	Guam.	0
450	Donald Trump	Nearby.	0
451	Donald Trump	I said, "Oh, great, nearby.	0
452	Donald Trump	Where's nearby?"	0
453	Donald Trump	Six and a half hours.	0
454	Donald Trump	Six and a half hours -- that's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place, and then go back to Guam.	0
455	Donald Trump	I know a lot about airplanes; it's very expensive.	0
456	Donald Trump	And I didn't like it.	0
457	Donald Trump	And what I did say is -- and I think it's very provocative, I have to tell you, Jennifer, it's a very provocative situation when I see that, and you have a country right next door.	0
458	Donald Trump	So under the circumstances that we are negotiating a very comprehensive, complete deal, I think it's inappropriate to be having war games.	0
459	Donald Trump	So, number one, we save money -- a lot.	0
460	Donald Trump	And number two, it really is something that I think they very much appreciate it.	0
461	Question	Does North Korea give you something in return, though?	0
462	Donald Trump	Well, we've gotten -- you know, I've heard that.	0
463	Donald Trump	I mean, some of the people that -- I don't know, maybe they really mean it.	0
464	Donald Trump	I don't always want to go against the press because I just don't -- especially not today, this is too important.	0
465	Donald Trump	But I noticed that some of the people were saying that the President has agreed to meet, he has given up so much.	0
466	Donald Trump	I gave up nothing.	0
467	Donald Trump	I'm here.	0
468	Donald Trump	I haven't slept in 25 hours, but I thought it was appropriate to do -- because we have been negotiating for literally around the clock with them, and with us, and with John, and with Mike, and a whole team of very talented people.	0
469	Donald Trump	But we haven't given up anything, other than -- you're right, I agreed to meet.	0
470	Donald Trump	And I think the meeting was every bit as good for the United States as it was for North Korea.	0
471	Donald Trump	But I just wrote down some of the things we got.	0
472	Donald Trump	And they -- you know, they -- sure, they got a meeting.	0
473	Donald Trump	But only a person that dislikes Donald Trump would say that I've agreed to make a big commitment.	0
474	Donald Trump	Sure, I've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet, and that's good.	0
475	Donald Trump	But I think it's great for us, as a country, and I think it's good for them.	0
476	Donald Trump	But what did they do to justify this meeting?	0
477	Donald Trump	Secured commitment for complete denuclearization; that's the big thing.	0
478	Donald Trump	They secured the release of three American hostages.	0
479	Donald Trump	They already gave them to us two months ago.	0
480	Donald Trump	These people are now living happily back in their homes, with their families.	0
481	Donald Trump	And it was pretty rough for them, to put it mildly.	0
482	Donald Trump	Secure the commitment to recover the remains, including -- these are of fallen heroes.	0
483	Donald Trump	And they're giving a commitment, they're starting it immediately, to recover their remains.	0
484	Donald Trump	And I just went through how many people asked me about it.	0
485	Donald Trump	I was amazed, actually.	0
486	Donald Trump	So many people would ask me, "Is it possible?	0
487	Donald Trump	Is it possible?"	0
488	Donald Trump	At that time we had no relationship to Chairman Kim or to anybody else in North Korea.	0
489	Donald Trump	You know, it was a very closed society.	0
490	Donald Trump	So we're getting the remains back.	0
491	Donald Trump	Secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for -- how long has it been?	0
492	Donald Trump	Seven months?	0
493	Donald Trump	You haven't had a missile go up.	0
494	Donald Trump	For seven months, you haven't had a nuclear test; you haven't had a nuclear explosion.	0
495	Donald Trump	I remember a nuclear event took place -- 8.8 in the Richter scale.	0
496	Donald Trump	And they announced -- I heard it on the radio -- they announced that a massive -- you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in Asia.	0
497	Donald Trump	And then they said it was in North Korea.	0
498	Donald Trump	And then they found out it was a nuclear test.	0
499	Donald Trump	I said, "I never heard of a Richter scale in the high 8s."	0
500	Donald Trump	And if you look, there has been no missile launches.	0
501	Donald Trump	They've blown up their missile area.	0
502	Donald Trump	That's going to take place.	0
503	Donald Trump	That has not been written into the contract.	0
504	Donald Trump	We're going to give you the exact details on that.	0
505	Donald Trump	But they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests.	0
506	Donald Trump	They secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test site.	0
507	Donald Trump	All three of them -- they're in an area that's common around each other -- they secured the closure.	0
508	Donald Trump	They secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site.	0
509	Donald Trump	That was not in your agreement.	0
510	Donald Trump	I got that after we signed the agreement.	0
511	Donald Trump	I said, "Do me a favor.	0
512	Donald Trump	You've got this missile engine testing site.	0
513	Donald Trump	We know where it is because of the heat."	0
514	Donald Trump	It's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you.	0
515	Donald Trump	I said, "Can you close it up?"	0
516	Donald Trump	He's going to close it up.	0
517	Donald Trump	We maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions.	0
518	Donald Trump	So we're applying sanctions.	0
519	Donald Trump	Now I had 300 sanctions that I was getting ready to put on last week.	0
520	Donald Trump	And I said, you know, I can't really put on sanctions when I'm meeting with -- I thought it would be very disrespectful.	0
521	Donald Trump	Three hundred very big ones, powerful ones.	0
522	Donald Trump	And I said it would be disrespectful.	0
523	Donald Trump	So, Jennifer, when you look at all of those things that we got -- and when we got our hostages back, I didn't pay $1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran, which was a disgraceful situation, what took place.	0
524	Donald Trump	So we've gotten a lot.	0
525	Donald Trump	So when I hear somebody in the media say that President Trump has agreed to meet -- like, it's not a big deal to meet.	0
526	Donald Trump	I think we should meet on a lot of different topics, not just this one.	0
527	Donald Trump	And I really believe a lot of great things can happen.	0
528	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
529	Donald Trump	Go ahead, please.	0
530	Question	Sir, you just listed off a lot of things that you say you got in this meeting.	0
531	Question	It wasn't too long ago, though, that you said you defined the success of this meeting by North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.	0
532	Donald Trump	Well, that's what they're doing.	0
533	Question	Well, can you talk about how --	0
534	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
535	Donald Trump	That's what they're doing.	0
536	Donald Trump	I mean, I don't think the --	0
537	Question	-- how you pressed Kim Jong Un for complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization?	0
538	Donald Trump	Yeah, I did, honestly --	0
539	Question	And can you why you didn't secure those details in this agreement?	0
540	Donald Trump	Because there was no time.	0
541	Donald Trump	I'm here one day.	0
542	Donald Trump	We're together for many hours intensively, but the process is now going to take place.	0
543	Donald Trump	And I would be surprised, Mike, if they haven't even started already.	0
544	Donald Trump	They have started; they blew up their sites.	0
545	Donald Trump	They blew up their testing site.	0
546	Donald Trump	But I will say, he knew, prior to coming -- you know, this wasn't like a surprise.	0
547	Donald Trump	It wasn't like we've never discussed it.	0
548	Donald Trump	We discussed it.	0
549	Donald Trump	Mike discussed it very strongly with his counterpart in North Korea.	0
550	Donald Trump	They knew that this was -- let's say they didn't agree to that I couldn't sign any agreement.	0
551	Donald Trump	There was no agreement that could have been signed.	0
552	Donald Trump	So they understood that.	0
553	Donald Trump	And it wasn't a big point today because, really, this had been taken care of, more than any other thing.	0
554	Donald Trump	Because it was all about this.	0
555	Donald Trump	This has been taken care of before we got here.	0
556	Donald Trump	So when we brought that up today, you see the language.	0
557	Donald Trump	It's very strong.	0
558	Donald Trump	It's in the document.	0
559	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.	0
560	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
561	Question	Could you talk about the military consequences for North Korea if they don't follow through on the commitments that you're talking about?	0
562	Question	Could there be military action?	0
563	Donald Trump	Well, I don't want to talk.	0
564	Donald Trump	Yeah, I know.	0
565	Donald Trump	That's a tough thing to talk about because I don't want to be threatening.	0
566	Donald Trump	I don't want to be threatening.	0
567	Donald Trump	They understood that.	0
568	Donald Trump	And you've seen what was, perhaps, going to happen.	0
569	Donald Trump	And you know, Seoul has 28 million people.	0
570	Donald Trump	We think we have big cities.	0
571	Donald Trump	You look at New York, where it has 8 million people.	0
572	Donald Trump	We think it's a big city.	0
573	Donald Trump	Seoul has 28 million people.	0
574	Donald Trump	Think of that.	0
575	Donald Trump	And it's right next to the border.	0
576	Donald Trump	It's right next to the DMZ.	0
577	Donald Trump	It's right there.	0
578	Donald Trump	I mean, if this would have happened, I think -- you know, I've heard, oh, a hundred-thousand people.	0
579	Donald Trump	I think you could have lost 20 million people, 30 million people.	0
580	Donald Trump	This is really an honor for me to be doing this because I think, you know, potentially, you could have lost, you know, 30-, 40-, 50 million people.	0
581	Donald Trump	The city of Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, is right next to the border.	0
582	Question	You once spoke about fire and fury.	0
583	Question	Is that no longer the case?	0
584	Donald Trump	Well, at that time we needed, perhaps, fire and fury.	0
585	Donald Trump	Because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States.	0
586	Donald Trump	And certainly, Japan wasn't going to allow it either.	0
587	Donald Trump	Japan is right next door.	0
588	Question	One more thing.	0
589	Question	Mr. President, could you tell us about the video that you showed before this?	0
590	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
591	Question	When did you show that to Kim?	0
592	Question	What was the goal there?	0
593	Donald Trump	Today.	0
594	Donald Trump	Yeah, we had it made up by some -- I hope you liked it.	0
595	Donald Trump	I thought it was good.	0
596	Donald Trump	I thought it was interesting enough to show.	0
597	Donald Trump	One in English and one in Korean.	0
598	Donald Trump	And we had it made up.	0
599	Donald Trump	I showed it to him today.	0
600	Donald Trump	Actually, during the meeting -- toward the end of the meeting.	0
601	Donald Trump	And I think he loved it.	0
602	Donald Trump	They were giving -- we didn't have a big screen like you have the luxury of having.	0
603	Donald Trump	We didn't need it because we had it on a cassette and -- an iPad.	0
604	Donald Trump	And they played it.	0
605	Donald Trump	And about eight of their representatives were watching it, and I thought they were fascinated.	0
606	Donald Trump	But I thought it was well done.	0
607	Donald Trump	I showed it to you because that's the future.	0
608	Donald Trump	I mean, that could very well be the future.	0
609	Donald Trump	And the other alternative is just not a very good alternative.	0
610	Donald Trump	It's just not good.	0
611	Donald Trump	But I showed it because I really want him to do something.	0
612	Donald Trump	Now, I don't think I had to show it because I really believe he wants to -- I think he wants to get it done.	0
613	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
614	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
615	Donald Trump	How's Staten Island Ferry doing?	0
616	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
617	Donald Trump	He wrote the best story about me with the Staten Island Ferry.	0
618	Donald Trump	And after that, he's never written a good story.	0
619	Question	That's a long time ago, sir.	0
620	Donald Trump	I don't know what happened.	0
621	Donald Trump	It's a long time ago.	0
622	Question	Mr. President, it's been a busy week for you on the international stage.	0
623	Question	You're leaving this summit here in Singapore having determined that Kim Jong Un is a talented man.	0
624	Question	You left the G7 Summit a few days ago in Canada having determined that Prime Minister Trudeau is weak and dishonest.	0
625	Question	What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends?	0
626	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, I think it's a very fair question.	0
627	Donald Trump	I had a very good meeting with the G7.	0
628	Donald Trump	And I left the meeting.	0
629	Donald Trump	And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries.	0
630	Donald Trump	Very, very seriously.	0
631	Donald Trump	Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason.	0
632	Donald Trump	For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second -- $151 billion we lost.	0
633	Donald Trump	They were represented at the meeting.	0
634	Donald Trump	And we're being taken advantage of on trade.	0
635	Donald Trump	Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits.	0
636	Donald Trump	We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus.	0
637	Donald Trump	Not a surplus.	0
638	Donald Trump	It's either 17, but it could actually be 100.	0
639	Donald Trump	You know, they put out a document.	0
640	Donald Trump	I don't know if you saw it.	0
641	Donald Trump	They didn't want me to see it, but we found it.	0
642	Donald Trump	Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have.	0
643	Donald Trump	It's close to $100 billion a year loss with Canada.	0
644	Donald Trump	They don't take our farm products -- many of them.	0
645	Donald Trump	They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products.	0
646	Donald Trump	And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country -- the workers, the farmers, the companies.	0
647	Donald Trump	And we are not able to trade.	0
648	Donald Trump	They have tremendous barriers up.	0
649	Donald Trump	They have tremendous tariffs.	0
650	Donald Trump	So when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much -- it's like this -- they said, "Oh, that's so terrible."	0
651	Donald Trump	I said, "What's terrible?"	0
652	Donald Trump	We have to catch you a little bit.	0
653	Donald Trump	We have to have a little balance.	0
654	Donald Trump	Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance.	0
655	Donald Trump	I say this with many countries.	0
656	Donald Trump	Anyway, we came -- we finished the meeting.	0
657	Donald Trump	Really, everybody was happy.	0
658	Donald Trump	And I agreed to sign something.	0
659	Donald Trump	I asked for changes; I demanded changes.	0
660	Donald Trump	And those changes were made.	0
661	Donald Trump	In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.	0
662	Donald Trump	That was a very friendly -- I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways.	0
663	Donald Trump	I was angry at her or she -- actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.	0
664	Donald Trump	Anyway, I left and it was very friendly.	0
665	Donald Trump	When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television.	0
666	Donald Trump	And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States.	0
667	Donald Trump	And I say, push him around?	0
668	Donald Trump	We just shook hands.	0
669	Donald Trump	It was very friendly.	0
670	Donald Trump	Look, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade.	0
671	Donald Trump	The number are out.	0
672	Donald Trump	Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years -- but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China.	0
673	Donald Trump	Eight-hundred billion dollars.	0
674	Donald Trump	A hundred fifty-one billion with the European Union.	0
675	Donald Trump	They don't take our agricultural products, barely.	0
676	Donald Trump	They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions.	0
677	Donald Trump	It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers.	0
678	Donald Trump	And I'm going to straighten it out.	0
679	Donald Trump	And it won't even be tough.	0
680	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
681	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
682	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
683	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
684	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
685	Donald Trump	I would like to involve Congress, yes.	0
686	Donald Trump	And no, I have a good relationship with Justin Trudeau.	0
687	Donald Trump	I really did.	0
688	Donald Trump	Other than he had a news conference that he had because he assumed I was in an airplane and I wasn't watching.	0
689	Donald Trump	He learned.	0
690	Donald Trump	That's going to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada.	0
691	Donald Trump	He learned.	0
692	Donald Trump	You can't do that.	0
693	Donald Trump	You can't do that.	0
694	Donald Trump	We laughed.	0
695	Donald Trump	We had a very good relationship.	0
696	Donald Trump	I've had a good relationship with Justin.	0
697	Donald Trump	I have a good relationship with all.	0
698	Donald Trump	I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.	0
699	Donald Trump	But on NATO, we're paying 4.2 percent; she's paying 1 percent of a much smaller GDP than we have.	0
700	Donald Trump	We're paying 4.2 percent on a much larger -- we're paying for -- I mean, anyone can say -- from 60 to 90 percent of NATO.	0
701	Donald Trump	And we're protecting countries of Europe.	0
702	Donald Trump	And then on top of it, they kill us on trade.	0
703	Donald Trump	So we just can't have it that way.	0
704	Donald Trump	It's unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.	0
705	Donald Trump	But no, I have a good relationship with Justin.	0
706	Donald Trump	And I have a, I think, a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now.	0
707	Donald Trump	I really do.	0
708	Donald Trump	I think -- I hope it's good because if it is, we're going to solve a very big problem.	0
709	Donald Trump	I think we've gone a long way to solving it today.	0
710	Donald Trump	Should we keep going for a little while?	0
711	Donald Trump	Sarah?	0
712	Donald Trump	I don't know.	0
713	Donald Trump	It's up to the legendary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.	0
714	Donald Trump	Should we keep going, Sarah?	0
715	Donald Trump	Okay, we'll go.	0
716	Donald Trump	Well, I don't care.	0
717	Donald Trump	Hey, you know, it just means we get home a little later in the evening.	0
718	Donald Trump	Right?	0

725	Donald Trump	How are you?	0
726	Question	I'm good.	0
727	Donald Trump	Nice to see you.	0
728	Question	From The Straits Times of Singapore.	0
729	Question	Welcome to the country.	0
730	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
731	Question	I hope you enjoyed our food.	0
732	Donald Trump	Beautiful country.	0
733	Donald Trump	I did.	0
734	Question	I just wanted to find out.	0
735	Question	You described this as a process.	0
736	Question	What is the immediate next step?	0
737	Question	Is there some ongoing dialogue --	0
738	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
739	Donald Trump	We're getting together next week to go into the details. And that's	0
740	SYSTEM	[inaudible]	0
741	Donald Trump	?	0
742	Donald Trump	Secretary Pompeo.	0
743	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
744	Donald Trump	Next week, with John Bolton and our entire team, to go over the details and to get this stuff done.	0
745	Donald Trump	We want to get it done; he wants to get it done.	0
746	Donald Trump	We're also working very much with South Korea.	0
747	Donald Trump	We're working with Japan.	0
748	Donald Trump	We're working with China, to a lesser extent, but we're working with China.	0
749	Question	And you are coming back to Singapore?	0
750	Donald Trump	I would come back gladly.	0
751	Donald Trump	Your Prime Minister was fantastic.	0
752	Donald Trump	We were with him yesterday.	0
753	Donald Trump	He's done a great job.	0
754	Donald Trump	It was very welcoming.	0
755	Donald Trump	It really, probably had -- it probably made a difference, actually.	0
756	Donald Trump	It's a great place.	0
757	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
758	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
759	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.	0
760	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
761	Question	What was it about that first interaction with Chairman Kim this morning that that made you decide not to walk away after you said that you would know within the first minute if he was sincere or not?	0
762	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
763	Donald Trump	I've said that about relationships.	0
764	Donald Trump	I've said that about people.	0
765	Donald Trump	You know in the first second.	0
766	Donald Trump	Now, I was generous.	0
767	Donald Trump	I said five seconds.	0
768	Donald Trump	But you know in the first second, in some cases.	0
769	Donald Trump	Sometimes that doesn't work out.	0
770	Donald Trump	But sometimes it does.	0
771	Donald Trump	From the beginning, we got along.	0
772	Donald Trump	But there's been a lot of groundwork.	0
773	Donald Trump	This wasn't like we went and we started talking about -- as you know, right?	0
774	Donald Trump	We didn't just come in and start talking about these very complex subjects that have been going on for 70 years.	0
775	Donald Trump	We've been discussing this for months.	0
776	Donald Trump	And, you know, once the rhetoric stopped, once they did a great thing --you know, North Korea did a great thing by going to the Olympics.	0
777	Donald Trump	Because the Olympics -- and President Moon will tell you this -- the Olympics was not exactly doing great.	0
778	Donald Trump	People didn't feel like being bombed out of the Opening Ceremonies.	0
779	Donald Trump	You know, they weren't exactly selling tickets.	0
780	Donald Trump	And as soon as the Chairman -- Chairman Kim -- said, "Let's participate in the Olympics," it sold like wildfire and was a great success as an Olympics.	0
781	Donald Trump	It was a great success.	0
782	Donald Trump	He did a great thing.	0
783	Donald Trump	But since that time, pretty much since that time -- because, as you know, a delegation came from South Korea who had just met with North Korea.	0
784	Donald Trump	They came to the White House.	0
785	Donald Trump	They told me lots of things, including the fact that they'd be willing to denuke.	0
786	Donald Trump	We have one of their great people here today.	0
787	Donald Trump	That they were willing to denuke.	0
788	Donald Trump	And once that started, we have been really talking about that from the end of the Olympics when the whole delegation came to say various things, including denuking.	0
789	Question	If I may, a second question.	0
790	Question	In the document that you signed earlier today, North Korea agreed to commit to denuclearization.	0
791	Question	To borrow a phrase that you have used to criticize your predecessors and political opponents, how do you ensure that North Korea is not all talk, no action going forward?	0
792	Donald Trump	Well, I think can you ensure anything?	0
793	Donald Trump	Can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down?	0
794	Donald Trump	I mean, you can't ensure anything.	0
795	Donald Trump	All I can say is they want to make a deal.	0
796	Donald Trump	That's what I do.	0
797	Donald Trump	My whole life has been deals.	0
798	Donald Trump	I've done great at it, and that's what I do.	0
799	Donald Trump	And I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't.	0
800	Donald Trump	A lot of politicians don't.	0
801	Donald Trump	That's not their thing, but it is my thing.	0
802	Donald Trump	I mean, again, this really could have been done, I think, easier a long time ago.	0
803	Donald Trump	But I know for a -- I just feel very strongly -- my instinct, my ability, or talent -- they want to make a deal.	0
804	Donald Trump	And making a deal is a great thing for the world.	0
805	Donald Trump	It's also a great thing for China because I can't imagine that China has, you know, is happy with somebody having nuclear weapons so close.	0
806	Donald Trump	So, you know, that's -- China was very helpful.	0
807	Donald Trump	So I think he wants to make a deal.	0
808	Donald Trump	Can anybody be certain?	0
809	Donald Trump	But we're going to be certain soon because the negotiations continue.	0
810	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
811	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
812	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
813	Question	You mentioned that you have raised extensively the issue of human rights with Chairman Kim.	0
814	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
815	Question	I wonder what you would say to the group of people who have no ability whatsoever to hear or to see this press conference -- the 100,000 North Koreans kept in a network of gulags.	0
816	Question	Have you betrayed them by legitimizing the regime in Pyongyang?	0
817	Donald Trump	No, I think I've helped them because I think things will change.	0
818	Donald Trump	I think I've helped them.	0
819	Donald Trump	There's nothing I can say.	0
820	Donald Trump	All I can do is do what I can do.	0
821	Donald Trump	We have to stop the nuclearization.	0
822	Donald Trump	We have to do other things, and that's a very important thing.	0
823	Donald Trump	So at a certain point, hopefully, you'll be able to ask me a much more positive question or make a statement.	0
824	Donald Trump	But not much I can do right now.	0
825	Donald Trump	At a certain point, I really believe he's going to do things about it.	0
826	Donald Trump	I think they are one of the great winners today, that large group of people that you're talking about.	0
827	Donald Trump	I think, ultimately, they're going to be one of the great winners as a group.	0
828	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.	0
829	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
830	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
831	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
832	Question	Would you ever consider removing the sanctions without significant improvement in the human rights situation?	0
833	Donald Trump	No.	0
834	Donald Trump	I want significant improvement.	0
835	Donald Trump	I want to know that it won't be happening.	0
836	Donald Trump	And again, once you start that process, there will be a point at which, even though you won't be finished for a while because it can't happen scientifically or mechanically, but you're not going to be able to go back.	0
837	Donald Trump	You know, once we reach that point, I'll start to give that very serious thought.	0
838	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
839	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
840	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
841	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
842	Donald Trump	You first.	0
843	Question	Mr. President, did you also discuss the cost of denuclearization and how North Korea is about to foot the bill while the crippling sanctions remain in place? I'm from	0
844	SYSTEM	[inaudible]	0
845	Question	News Agency Singapore.	0
846	Donald Trump	Well, I think that South Korea and I think that Japan will help them very greatly.	0
847	Donald Trump	I think they're prepared to help them.	0
848	Donald Trump	They know they're going to have to help them.	0
849	Donald Trump	I think they're going to help them very greatly.	0
850	Donald Trump	We won't have to help them.	0
851	Donald Trump	The United States has been paying a big price in a lot of different places.	0
852	Donald Trump	But South Korea, which obviously is right next door, and Japan, which essentially is next door, they're going to be helping them.	0
853	Donald Trump	And I think they're going to be doing a very generous job and a terrific job.	0
854	Donald Trump	So they will be helping them.	0
855	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.	0
856	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
857	Donald Trump	Behind.	0
858	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
859	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
860	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
861	Question	I'd like to follow up on Steve's question.	0
862	Question	He asked you how long it would take to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.	0
863	Question	You said a long time.	0
864	Question	What does that mean?	0
865	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know, when you say a long time.	0
866	Donald Trump	I think we will do it as fast as it can be done scientifically, as fast as it can be done mechanically.	0
867	Donald Trump	I don't think -- I mean, I've read horror stories.	0
868	Donald Trump	It's a 15-year process.	0
869	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
870	Donald Trump	Assuming you wanted to do it quickly, I don't believe that.	0
871	Donald Trump	I think whoever wrote that is wrong.	0
872	Donald Trump	But there will be a point at which, when you're 20 percent through, you can't go back.	0
873	Donald Trump	I had an uncle who was a great professor for, I believe, 40 years at MIT.	0
874	Donald Trump	And I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time.	0
875	Donald Trump	He was a great expert.	0
876	Donald Trump	He was a great, brilliant genius.	0
877	Donald Trump	Dr. John Trump at MIT.	0
878	Donald Trump	I think he was there 40 years, I was told.	0
879	Donald Trump	In fact, the head of MIT sent me a book on my uncle.	0
880	Donald Trump	But we used to talk about nuclear.	0
881	Donald Trump	You're talking about a very complex subject.	0
882	Donald Trump	It's not just like, "Oh, gee.	0
883	Donald Trump	Let's get rid of the nukes."	0
884	Donald Trump	It takes a period of time.	0
885	Donald Trump	But the main period of time that I'm talking is that first period, when you hit a certain point you can't go back.	0
886	Donald Trump	It's very hard to go back.	0
887	Question	And how long will that take?	0
888	Donald Trump	We don't know, but it will go pretty quickly.	0
889	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
890	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
891	Question	Thanks, Mr. President.	0
892	Question	I wanted to ask again on the sanctions campaign.	0
893	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
894	Question	You alluded at the very beginning that the Chinese are not doing as great a job securing the border as they were before.	0
895	Question	You expressed some doubts when Kim went to see President Xi.	0
896	Question	The Russian foreign minister was in Pyongyang and said there shouldn't be any sanctions while these negotiations are under way.	0
897	Question	And the South Koreans are now talking about restoring some form of trade.	0
898	Question	So with all of those players appearing to be moving toward eroding sanctions, how can you keep the sanctions regime in place?	0
899	Question	What leverage do you have on these countries?	0
900	Donald Trump	Well, I think we have a lot of leverage.	0
901	Donald Trump	I think we have tremendous leverage.	0
902	Donald Trump	I do believe that China, despite my relationship with President Xi -- a man who I told you I have great respect for and like, also, a lot.	0
903	Donald Trump	You know, we're having very tough talks on trade.	0
904	Donald Trump	And I think that probably affects China somewhat.	0
905	Donald Trump	But I have to do what I have to do.	0
906	Donald Trump	And I think, over the last two months, the border is more open than it was when we first started.	0
907	Donald Trump	But that is what it is.	0
908	Donald Trump	We have to do it.	0
909	Donald Trump	We have a tremendous deficit in trade, commonly known as a trade deficit.	0
910	Donald Trump	We have a tremendous deficit in trade with China, and we have to do something about it.	0
911	Donald Trump	We can't continue to let that happen.	0
912	Donald Trump	And I think that has had an impact on my relationship, in terms of the border.	0
913	Donald Trump	I don't think it has the relationship -- you know, I don't think it affects my feeling or my relationship to President Xi.	0
914	Donald Trump	But when we first started, we weren't ready to go that route.	0
915	Donald Trump	And as we started preparing and getting ready to do that, I think that's had an impact on, frankly, the border.	0
916	Donald Trump	Which is a shame.	0
917	Donald Trump	But I have to do it.	0
918	Donald Trump	I have no choice.	0
919	Donald Trump	For our country, I have to do it.	0
920	Donald Trump	South Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal done.	0
921	Donald Trump	And if that means we can't trade, then I'm not going to trade.	0
922	Donald Trump	They're definitely not going to trade.	0
923	Donald Trump	If they think -- and they would do this with our concurrence -- if they think that they can do some work because we're very far down the line -- we're actually very far.	0
924	Donald Trump	You know, that document, when you read it today, that's far down the line.	0
925	Donald Trump	That's not something that just happened to be put together.	0
926	Donald Trump	This was done over months.	0
927	Donald Trump	And again, the rhetoric was important, and the sanctions were important.	0
928	Donald Trump	I don't even know which one was more important.	0
929	Donald Trump	They were both important.	0
930	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
931	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
932	Question	Mr. President, David Sanger for The New York Times.	0
933	Question	I was wondering if you could give us some sense of whether the Chairman Kim told you how many nuclear weapons he believes he's made, whether he's willing to turn those over first, and then whether, in your mind, you need to do more than was done in the Iran deal for actually dismantling the -- both the uranium and the plutonium processes.	0
934	Question	And whether or not you had a sense that Chairman Kim really understood what that involves and had a timetable in his own mind of shutting that.	0
935	Donald Trump	Well, David, I can tell you he understands.	0
936	Donald Trump	He understands it so well.	0
937	Donald Trump	He understands it better than the people that are doing the work for him.	0
938	Donald Trump	That is an easy one.	0
939	Donald Trump	As far as what he has, it's substantial.	0
940	Donald Trump	Very substantial.	0
941	Donald Trump	The timing will go quickly.	0
942	Donald Trump	I believe you'll see some good action.	0
943	Donald Trump	I mean, as an example, one of the things with the missile site, I think you're probably surprised to hear that -- that was a throw-in at the end, the missile site.	0
944	Donald Trump	But I really believe, David, that it's going to go very quickly.	0
945	Donald Trump	I really believe that it's going to go fast.	0
946	Donald Trump	And it is a very substantial arsenal.	0
947	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.	0
948	Donald Trump	You know, I used to say maybe it's all talk and no action.	0
949	Donald Trump	But we have pretty good intelligence into that.	0
950	Donald Trump	Although, probably less there than any other country.	0
951	Donald Trump	You understand that maybe better than anybody in the room.	0
952	Donald Trump	Probably less there than any other country.	0
953	Donald Trump	But we have enough intelligence to know that what they have is very substantial.	0
954	Donald Trump	This is why, David, I always say that this shouldn't have taken place so late into the process.	0
955	Donald Trump	Wouldn't this have been better if it was 5 years ago or 20 years ago or 15 years ago and we didn't have to worry about not having a successful meeting like today?	0
956	Donald Trump	So -- and I still love my first interview with you, David.	0
957	Donald Trump	I still have that interview, actually.	0
958	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
959	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
960	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
961	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
962	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
963	Donald Trump	the second summit -- if there is a second summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un, would it be in Pyongyang or Washington?	0
964	Donald Trump	We haven't set that up.	0
965	Donald Trump	We'll probably need another summit.	0
966	Donald Trump	We'll probably need -- or meeting.	0
967	Donald Trump	We can use a different term.	0
968	Donald Trump	But we'll probably need another one.	0
969	Donald Trump	We'll probably -- I will say this, we're much further along than I would have thought.	0
970	Donald Trump	I did not think we'd be here.	0
971	Donald Trump	I thought -- and I've told people -- I didn't want to build up people's hopes too much.	0
972	Donald Trump	I told people I thought that this would be a successful meeting if we got along, we developed a relationship, and we could have maybe gotten to this point in three or four months from now.	0
973	Donald Trump	But it really happened very quickly.	0
974	Donald Trump	A lot of that was because of the foundation that was, you know, put down before we met.	0
975	Donald Trump	A lot of things happened very fast.	0
976	Donald Trump	We didn't have -- as an example, bringing back the remains.	0
977	Donald Trump	That was not one of the things that was on our agenda today.	0
978	Donald Trump	I brought that up at the very end because so many people have talked to me about it.	0
979	Donald Trump	And I brought it up at the very end.	0
980	Donald Trump	And he was really very gracious.	0
981	Donald Trump	Instead of saying, "Well, let's talk about it the next time."	0
982	Donald Trump	He said, "It makes sense.	0
983	Donald Trump	We will do it."	0
984	Donald Trump	And he knew -- you know, they know where many of those incredible people are.	0
985	Donald Trump	Where they're buried along roads, along highways, along paths, usually, because our soldiers were moving back and forth and they had to move rapidly.	0
986	Donald Trump	It's very sad.	0
987	Donald Trump	But he knew.	0
988	Donald Trump	And that was brought up at the very end.	0
989	Donald Trump	And you know, it was really great that he was able to do it.	0
990	Donald Trump	A lot of people are going to be very happy about that.	0
991	Donald Trump	Yes.	0

1001	Donald Trump	It's really beautiful what you do.	0
1002	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1003	Question	So you --	0
1004	Donald Trump	And now I'll probably get this killer question.	0
1005	SYSTEM	[Laughs]	0
1006	Donald Trump	Well, I do want to talk about the future of North Korea.	0
1007	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
1008	Donald Trump	It's all right.	0
1009	Question	Specifically the people are -- Kim Jong Un is saying he's wanting a brighter future with prosperity for his people, yet we know they've lived under oppression.	0
1010	Question	You showed him this video of what the future can be like.	0
1011	Question	But do you have an idea specifically of the model that you would like to go towards?	0
1012	Question	Economically, is he open to more economic freedom?	0
1013	Donald Trump	Yeah, it's a good question.	0
1014	Donald Trump	So you saw a tape today, and that, I think, was done really well.	0
1015	Donald Trump	But that was done at the highest level of future development.	0
1016	Donald Trump	I told him, you may not want this.	0
1017	Donald Trump	You may want to do a much smaller version of this.	0
1018	Donald Trump	I mean, you're going to do something.	0
1019	Donald Trump	But you may want to do a smaller version.	0
1020	Donald Trump	You may not want that with the trains and the everything.	0
1021	Donald Trump	You know, it's super -- everything the top.	0
1022	Donald Trump	And maybe you won't want that.	0
1023	Donald Trump	It's going to be up to them.	0
1024	Donald Trump	It's going to be up to them.	0
1025	Donald Trump	It's going to be up to the people what they want.	0
1026	Donald Trump	They may not want that.	0
1027	Donald Trump	I can understand that too.	0
1028	Donald Trump	But that was a version of what could happen, what could take place.	0
1029	Donald Trump	As an example, they have great beaches.	0
1030	Donald Trump	You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right?	0
1031	Donald Trump	I said, "Boy, look at the view.	0
1032	Donald Trump	Wouldn't that make a great condo behind?"	0
1033	Donald Trump	And I explained, I said, "You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there."	0
1034	Donald Trump	Think of it from a real estate perspective.	0
1035	Donald Trump	You have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle.	0
1036	Donald Trump	How bad is that, right?	0
1037	Donald Trump	It's great.	0
1038	Donald Trump	But I told him, I said, you may not want to do what's there.	0
1039	Donald Trump	You may want to do a smaller version of it or -- you know.	0
1040	Donald Trump	And that could be.	0
1041	Donald Trump	Although, I tell you what -- he looked at that tape, he looked at that iPad, and I'm telling you they really enjoyed it, I believe.	0
1042	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
1043	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
1044	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1045	Donald Trump	A couple more.	0
1046	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
1047	Donald Trump	We'll do three more.	0
1048	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
1049	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1050	Donald Trump	Go.	0
1051	Question	Brian Bennett from Time Magazine.	0
1052	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
1053	Donald Trump	Hi, Brian.	0
1054	Donald Trump	Am I on the cover again this week?	0
1055	Donald Trump	Boy, have I -- so many covers.	0
1056	Question	It's entirely possible.	0
1057	Donald Trump	Huh?	0
1058	Donald Trump	I know.	0
1059	Donald Trump	That's okay.	0
1060	Question	Do you now see Kim Jong Un as an equal?	0
1061	Donald Trump	In what way?	0
1062	Question	You just showed a video that showed you and Kim Jong Un on equal footing in discussing the future of --	0
1063	Donald Trump	No.	0
1064	Donald Trump	I think that -- I don't view it that way.	0
1065	Donald Trump	See, I don't view it that way.	0
1066	Donald Trump	I'll do whatever it takes to make the world a safer place.	0
1067	Donald Trump	If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage -- I mean, I understand what you're getting at.	0
1068	Donald Trump	If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage with Chairman Kim and that's going to get us to save 30 million lives -- could be more than that -- I'm willing to sit on the stage.	0
1069	Donald Trump	I'm willing to travel to Singapore very proudly, very gladly.	0
1070	Donald Trump	Again, I -- you know, other than the fact that it is taking my time, they have given up a tremendous amount.	0
1071	Donald Trump	They've given it up even before.	0
1072	Donald Trump	And even add the Olympics to it.	0
1073	Donald Trump	You know, you could add the Olympics to the question.	0
1074	Donald Trump	They went to the Olympics.	0
1075	Donald Trump	They took an Olympics that was going to be a massive failure that maybe wouldn't have even opened, and they made it a tremendous success by agreeing to participate.	0
1076	Donald Trump	Add that to the list of things that they've done.	0
1077	Donald Trump	So, Brian, if I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honor to do it.	0
1078	Question	Are you concerned that the video you just showed could be used by Kim as propaganda to show him as an equal --	0
1079	Donald Trump	No, I'm not concerned at all.	0
1080	Donald Trump	We can use that video for other countries.	0
1081	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1082	Question	Mr. President, in the year 2000, President Clinton got a request by Kim Jong Il.	0
1083	Donald Trump	Got impressed?	0
1084	Question	Got a request --	0
1085	Donald Trump	Oh.	0
1086	Question	From Kim Jong Il to travel to Pyongyang and meet him.	0
1087	Question	And Clinton refused.	0
1088	Question	He sent Secretary of State Albright.	0
1089	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
1090	Donald Trump	He did a great deal.	0
1091	Donald Trump	And he spent $3 billion and got nothing.	0
1092	Donald Trump	And he started making nuclear weapons a day later.	0
1093	Question	Mr. President, you, on the other hand, got the request and right away went here to meet him.	0
1094	Question	And do you understand those people who say that you gave him the ultimate present -- the legitimacy to a regime who oppress its people without an ongoing process before you, as the U.S. President, as the leader of the free world, meet and shake hands with this leader of North Korea who is perceived to be oppressing brutally his own people?	0
1095	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
1096	Donald Trump	Good.	0
1097	Donald Trump	I think we just answered the question.	0
1098	Question	But do you understand those people?	0
1099	Donald Trump	Oh, I understand them much better than you do.	0
1100	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
1101	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
1102	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1103	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1104	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
1105	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
1106	Question	Mr. President, Eliana Johnson with Politico.	0
1107	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
1108	Donald Trump	Hi.	0
1109	Question	Hi.	0
1110	Question	You mentioned a couple specific concessions that you got from Kim: the return of remains and the destruction of the nuclear site.	0
1111	Question	And I know you said that was an add-on --	0
1112	Donald Trump	And much more.	0
1113	Donald Trump	And much more than that.	0
1114	Question	Yeah.	0
1115	Question	I know you said the last thing was an add-on and it wasn't in the agreement, but that he gave you his word.	0
1116	Question	If he doesn't follow through on these things, what are you prepared to do in response?	0
1117	Question	And will you lose faith in this process?	0
1118	Donald Trump	No.	0
1119	Donald Trump	I think he'll do it.	0
1120	Donald Trump	I really believe that.	0
1121	Donald Trump	Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing this.	0
1122	Donald Trump	I really believe it.	0
1123	Donald Trump	And it was really the engine testing site, in addition to all of the other things that they've agreed to do.	0
1124	Donald Trump	It was the -- they have a very powerful engine testing site that, again, we're able to see because of the heat that it emits.	0
1125	Donald Trump	And, yeah, I'm able to -- I'm very happy.	0
1126	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what -- I'm very happy with those two points -- the two points you mentioned.	0
1127	Donald Trump	But I think you might be referring to the thing that's not in, which is the engine testing site.	0
1128	Donald Trump	I think he's -- I think -- honestly, I think he's going to do these things.	0
1129	Donald Trump	I may be wrong.	0
1130	Donald Trump	I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, "Hey, I was wrong."	0
1131	Donald Trump	I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse.	0
1132	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
1133	Donald Trump	Okay, one or two.	0
1134	Donald Trump	One more.	0
1135	Donald Trump	Come on.	0

1144	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
1145	Donald Trump	I will.	0
1146	Question	And what's your expectation about China's role to accelerate the process to establish a long-term peace mechanism?	0
1147	Donald Trump	Well, my expectation about China is that China is a great country with a great leader, and a friend of mine.	0
1148	Donald Trump	And I really believe that he's happy that we've made this kind of progress.	0
1149	Donald Trump	And I've heard from him.	0
1150	Donald Trump	But I will be calling him very shortly.	0
1151	Donald Trump	Maybe even before I land.	0
1152	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
1153	Donald Trump	And I have to say, you know -- and the United States is a great country.	0
1154	Donald Trump	And we have set records economically -- over $7 trillion in net worth addition to what we have.	0
1155	Donald Trump	And we are almost twice the size, the economy of the United States.	0
1156	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about this, because you do hear a lot about China, rightfully so.	0
1157	Donald Trump	But the United States, now, is almost twice the size of the economy of China.	0
1158	Donald Trump	We have a great country and we're on a correct path.	0
1159	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
1160	Donald Trump	One more.	0
1161	Donald Trump	That will be it.	0

1174	Donald Trump	I just want to tell him about the meeting.	0

1179	Donald Trump	And I look forward to speaking.	0
1180	Donald Trump	He'll be very happy when he hears about -- I've already sent word to him about what happened.	0
1181	Donald Trump	I sent the document to him, actually, and all of the details behind the document.	0
1182	Donald Trump	So I'll be talking to him very shortly.	0
1183	Question	If I may ask another question.	0
1184	Question	In signing the peace treaty, do you hope to -- do you plan to work this out with North Korea's Chairman Kim only, or what do you think about the involvement of South Korea and China as the signatories?	0
1185	Donald Trump	I'd like to have them involved also.	0
1186	Donald Trump	There's a question as to whether or not we're supposed to or whether or not we legally have to.	0
1187	Donald Trump	I don't care.	0
1188	Donald Trump	I think it would be great to have China involved and also, of course, South Korea.	0

1199	Donald Trump	I don't think they recorded it.	0

1224	Donald Trump	They're in the room.	0
1225	Donald Trump	We have a few people in the back also, in the room.	0

1227	Donald Trump	We went in with tremendous relationship and tremendous knowledge.	0
1228	Donald Trump	And I think that's why we got it done.	0
1229	Donald Trump	So I'm going to head back.	0
