24	STEPHANOPOULOS	And on the stage, you see them.	0
25	STEPHANOPOULOS	They have all met the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee.	0
26	STEPHANOPOULOS	At least 10 others have not met the threshold.	0
27	STEPHANOPOULOS	So, for the first time in this primary, a single debate in a single night with all the top candidates facing off.	0
28	STEPHANOPOULOS	It is a critical test for the candidates and their campaigns at a critical time for our country.	0
29	STEPHANOPOULOS	They're going to lay out their vision for the country, their records, their differences with President Trump and each other.	0
30	STEPHANOPOULOS	And we're going to do our best to bring you a lively, informative, and civil debate.	0

35	SYSTEM	(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
36	RAMOS	Let me just give you a little translation here.	0
37	RAMOS	I'm telling Latinos that, despite the fact that we are facing difficult times, this is our country, too.	0
38	RAMOS	Linsey?	0
39	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0

57	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
58	CASTRO	It's great to be here at TSU, home of the Tigers.	0
59	CASTRO	You know, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we're going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.	0
60	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
61	CASTRO	There will be life after Donald Trump.	0
62	CASTRO	But the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump, and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas.	0
63	CASTRO	We need a bold vision: universal pre-K and universal health care, unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy, a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.	0

69	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Klobuchar?	0
70	KLOBUCHAR	Good evening, Texas Southern.	0
71	KLOBUCHAR	I believe that what unites us up here, the 10 of us, is much stronger than what divides us.	0
72	KLOBUCHAR	And I think that's true of our country, too.	0
73	KLOBUCHAR	Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House.	0
74	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
75	KLOBUCHAR	Houston, we have a problem.	0
76	KLOBUCHAR	This -- we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show.	0
77	KLOBUCHAR	He would rather lie than lead.	0
78	KLOBUCHAR	I think we need something different.	0
79	KLOBUCHAR	I am someone that tells the truth.	0
80	KLOBUCHAR	I don't make promises that I can't keep.	0
81	KLOBUCHAR	I have people's back.	0
82	KLOBUCHAR	And I believe that to win, you bring people with you and that is how you govern, as well.	0
83	KLOBUCHAR	So, you're going to hear a lot of ideas up here.	0
84	KLOBUCHAR	Some will be great.	0
85	KLOBUCHAR	But if you see that some of them seem a little off-track, I've got a better way.	0
86	KLOBUCHAR	If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me, because I don't want to be the president for half of America.	0
87	KLOBUCHAR	I want to be the president for all of America.	0
88	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
89	STEPHANOPOULOS	Congressman Beto O'Rourke?	0
90	O'ROURKE	It's an honor to be on this debate stage.	0
91	O'ROURKE	It is wonderful to be back in Texas, in Houston, back here at TSU.	0
92	O'ROURKE	On August 3rd, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country.	0
93	O'ROURKE	The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is, the cost and the consequence of his presidency.	0
94	O'ROURKE	A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our president.	0
95	O'ROURKE	The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now.	0
96	O'ROURKE	The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills, we have to be bigger.	0
97	O'ROURKE	We have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively.	0
98	O'ROURKE	That's what I want to do for you as president of the United States.	0
99	O'ROURKE	Thank you.	0
100	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
101	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Cory Booker?	0
102	BOOKER	It was over 20 years ago that I was a law student and moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, to serve as a tenants rights lawyer to try to address the challenges in my community.	0
103	BOOKER	And I was sobered by them -- the gun violence, the sub-standard housing.	0
104	BOOKER	But it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Ms. Virginia Jones, who challenged me.	0
105	BOOKER	She said, boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that's all there's ever going to be.	0
106	BOOKER	But if you're stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.	0
107	BOOKER	She was a church woman that said, without vision, the people will perish.	0
108	BOOKER	Well, that's exactly what we did.	0
109	BOOKER	We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people think -- thought was impossible.	0
110	BOOKER	That's the story of America.	0
111	BOOKER	At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose.	0
112	BOOKER	The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose.	0
113	BOOKER	That's why I'm running for president, and that's how I will lead this nation.	0
114	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
115	STEPHANOPOULOS	Entrepreneur Andrew Yang?	0
116	YANG	In America today, everything revolves around the almighty dollar -- our schools, our hospitals, our media, even our government.	0
117	YANG	It's why we don't trust our institutions anymore.	0
118	YANG	We have to get our country working for us again, instead of the other way around.	0
119	YANG	We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine.	0
120	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
121	YANG	When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens?	0
122	YANG	The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out.	0
123	YANG	It's time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.	0
124	YANG	That's why I'm going to do something unprecedented tonight.	0
125	YANG	My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.	0
126	YANG	If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.	0
127	YANG	This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people.	0
128	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
129	STEPHANOPOULOS	Mayor Pete Buttigieg?	0
130	BUTTIGIEG	It's original, I'll give you that.	0
131	BUTTIGIEG	The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we've ever seen.	0
132	BUTTIGIEG	As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know what's at stake in our national leadership.	0
133	BUTTIGIEG	We keep sending politicians to Washington asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us.	0
134	BUTTIGIEG	Good politics is supposed to be not about the day-to-day fights of the politicians, but about the day-to-day lives of Americans.	0
135	BUTTIGIEG	We just marked the anniversary of 9/11.	0
136	BUTTIGIEG	All day today, I've been thinking about September 12th, the way it felt when for a moment we came together as a country.	0
137	BUTTIGIEG	Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity.	0
138	BUTTIGIEG	Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people.	0
139	BUTTIGIEG	That's what presidential leadership can do.	0
140	BUTTIGIEG	That's what the presidency is for.	0
141	BUTTIGIEG	And that is why I'm asking for your vote.	0
142	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
143	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Kamala Harris?	0
144	HARRIS	Thank you.	0
145	HARRIS	It's great to be back at TSU.	0
146	HARRIS	So I plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night.	0
147	HARRIS	But first, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching.	0
148	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
149	HARRIS	So, President Trump, you've spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we've gotten nothing done.	0
150	HARRIS	You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises.	0
151	HARRIS	The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.	0
152	HARRIS	But here's what you don't get: What you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this.	0
153	HARRIS	And we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we're registered to vote.	0
154	HARRIS	And I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America.	0
155	HARRIS	And now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.	0
156	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
157	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Bernie Sanders?	0
158	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Sanders?	0
159	SANDERS	Let me be blunt and tell you what you don't hear much about in Congress or in the media, and that is, it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country.	0
160	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
161	SANDERS	But we must do more.	0
162	SANDERS	We must do more.	0
163	SANDERS	We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country.	0
164	SANDERS	And as president, I am prepared to take them on.	0
165	SANDERS	Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage.	0
166	SANDERS	Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has health care as a human right, not a privilege.	0
167	SANDERS	And, yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.	0
168	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
169	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Elizabeth Warren?	0
170	WARREN	So, I was born and raised in Oklahoma, but I'm sure glad to be in Texas tonight.	0
171	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
172	WARREN	All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas.	0
173	WARREN	That was their ticket to the middle class.	0
174	WARREN	Me, I got my big opportunity about a half-mile down the road from here at the University of Houston, back when it cost $50 a semester.	0
175	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
176	WARREN	For a price that I could pay for, on a part-time waitressing job, I got to finish my four-year degree and I became a special needs teacher.	0
177	WARREN	And after law school, my first big job was back here in Houston.	0
178	WARREN	By then, I had two little kids, and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt Bee moved in and saved us all.	0
179	WARREN	The paths to America's middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower.	0
180	WARREN	Today, service-members are preyed upon by predatory lenders.	0
181	WARREN	Students are crushed by debt.	0
182	WARREN	And families cannot afford childcare.	0
183	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
184	WARREN	I know what's broken.	0
185	WARREN	I know how to fix it.	0
186	WARREN	And I'm going to lead the fight to get it done.	0
187	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
188	STEPHANOPOULOS	Vice President Joe Biden.	0
189	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life.	0
190	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	He said, we're doing it because we refuse to postpone.	0
191	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases which, if we invest in them, we can find cures.	0
192	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	I refuse to postpone giving single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond.	0
193	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change.	0
194	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	Look, this is the United States of America.	0
195	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	There has never been a single solitary time when we've set our mind to something we've been unable to do it.	0
196	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	We're walking around with our heads down like woe is me.	0
197	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	We're the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on.	0
198	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	It's no longer time to postpone.	0
199	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	We should get moving.	0
200	JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.	0
201	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
202	STEPHANOPOULOS	Candidates, thank you.	0
203	STEPHANOPOULOS	Several of you said you are more united than divided, and that is certainly true.	0
204	STEPHANOPOULOS	All of you agree on one big thing, the goal of defeating President Trump, driving the country in a new direction.	0
205	STEPHANOPOULOS	But out on the campaign trail, you have outlined big differences over how far to go and how fast to go.	0
206	STEPHANOPOULOS	And, Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate.	0
207	STEPHANOPOULOS	Both senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for All.	0
208	STEPHANOPOULOS	You want to build on Obamacare, not scrap it.	0
209	STEPHANOPOULOS	They propose spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt.	0
210	STEPHANOPOULOS	And they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs.	0
211	STEPHANOPOULOS	Are senators Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go and where the country needs to go?	0
212	BIDEN	That will be for the voters to decide that question.	0
213	BIDEN	Let me tell you what I think.	0
214	BIDEN	I think we should have a debate on health care.	0
215	BIDEN	I think -- I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack.	0
216	BIDEN	I think the Obamacare worked.	0
217	BIDEN	I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.	0
218	BIDEN	Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are.	0
219	BIDEN	My plan for health care costs a lot of money.	0
220	BIDEN	It costs $740 billion.	0
221	BIDEN	It doesn't cost $30 trillion, $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is.	0
222	BIDEN	That's before -- exists now, without interest on the debt.	0
223	BIDEN	How are we going to pay for it?	0
224	BIDEN	I want to hear that tonight how that's happened.	0
225	BIDEN	Thus far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it.	0
226	BIDEN	And the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there.	0
227	BIDEN	There's a lot of other things that need to be done.	0
228	BIDEN	I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at-risk schools that are Title I schools, from 15 to $45 billion a year.	0
229	BIDEN	But I go down the line and these are things we're talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it's better.	0
230	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Warren, let me take that to you, particularly on what Senator Biden was saying there about health care.	0
231	STEPHANOPOULOS	He has actually praised Bernie Sanders for being candid about his health care plan, that Senator -- says that Sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated.	0
232	STEPHANOPOULOS	Will you make that same admission?	0
233	WARREN	So, let's be clear about health care.	0
234	WARREN	And let's actually start where vice president did.	0
235	WARREN	We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being.	0
236	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
237	WARREN	And now the question is, how best can we improve on it?	0
238	WARREN	And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost.	0
239	WARREN	How do we pay for it?	0
240	WARREN	We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more.	0
241	WARREN	And middle class families are going to pay less.	0
242	WARREN	That's how this is going to work.	0
243	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
244	STEPHANOPOULOS	Direct question.	0
245	STEPHANOPOULOS	You said middle class families are going to pay less.	0
246	STEPHANOPOULOS	But will middle class taxes go up to pail for pay for the program?	0
247	STEPHANOPOULOS	I know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down.	0
248	STEPHANOPOULOS	Will middle class taxes go up?	0
249	STEPHANOPOULOS	Will private insurance be eliminated?	0
250	WARREN	Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost.	0
251	WARREN	That's what they have to deal with.	0
252	WARREN	And understand, families are paying for their health care today.	0
253	WARREN	Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist.	0
254	WARREN	Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network, sorry, we are not covering that prescription.	0
255	WARREN	Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it.	0
256	WARREN	They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the co-pay.	0
257	WARREN	What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets, what's going to happen in their budgets.	0
258	WARREN	And the answer is on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations.	0
259	WARREN	But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.	0
260	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
261	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Sanders, you were invoked by the vice president, also take on that question about taxes.	0
262	SANDERS	Well, Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion.	0
263	SANDERS	That's right, Joe.	0
264	SANDERS	Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion.	0
265	SANDERS	Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country.	0
266	SANDERS	I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so...	0
267	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
268	SANDERS	... intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments.	0
269	SANDERS	Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we're going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.	0
270	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
271	SANDERS	We need -- we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies.	0
272	SANDERS	And I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for All is, because they want to protect their profits.	0
273	SANDERS	That is absurd.	0
274	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
275	STEPHANOPOULOS	Vice president Biden...	0
276	KLOBUCHAR	If I could respond, George.	0
277	STEPHANOPOULOS	You get a response and then we're going to broaden out the discussion.	0
278	BIDEN	OK, number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the costs of -- the largest out-of-pocket payment you'll pay is $1,000.	0
279	BIDEN	You'll be able to get into a -- anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, et cetera.	0
280	BIDEN	But guess what?	0
281	BIDEN	Of the 160 million people who like their health care now, they can keep it.	0
282	BIDEN	If they don't like it, they can leave.	0
283	BIDEN	Number one.	0
284	BIDEN	Number two, the fact of the matter is, we're in a situation where, if you notice, he hasn't answered the question.	0
285	BIDEN	This is about candor, honesty, big ideas.	0
286	BIDEN	Let's have a big idea.	0
287	BIDEN	The tax of 2 percent that the senator is talking about, that raises about $3 billion.	0
288	BIDEN	Guess what?	0
289	BIDEN	That leaves you $28 billion short.	0
290	BIDEN	The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your pay -- there will be a deductible, in your paycheck.	0
291	BIDEN	You're going to -- the middle class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more.	0
292	BIDEN	They're going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income tax.	0
293	BIDEN	That's a reality.	0
294	BIDEN	Now, it's not a bad idea if you like it.	0
295	BIDEN	I don't like it.	0
296	STEPHANOPOULOS	OK, now I want everybody to keep to the time, but you did invoke both senators.	0
297	STEPHANOPOULOS	I have to get responses from them...	0
298	BIDEN	Sure, no, that's good.	0
299	STEPHANOPOULOS	... and then we will broaden it out.	0
300	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Warren, you go first.	0
301	WARREN	So, let's be clear, I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.	0
302	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
303	WARREN	I've met people who like their doctors.	0
304	WARREN	I've met people who like their nurses.	0
305	WARREN	I've met people who like their pharmacists.	0
306	WARREN	I've met people who like their physical therapists.	0
307	WARREN	What they want is access to health care.	0
308	WARREN	And we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about.	0
309	WARREN	Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we're going to do this by saying, everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every health care provider is covered.	0
310	WARREN	And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill?	0
311	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Sanders.	0
312	SANDERS	Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.	0
313	BIDEN	This is America.	0
314	SANDERS	Yes, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries.	0
315	SANDERS	And they guarantee health care to all people.	0
316	SANDERS	Under my Medicare for All proposal, when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums, maybe you've run into people who love their premiums, I haven't.	0
317	SANDERS	What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.	0
318	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Klobuchar, you said in your opening statement you don't -- you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes.	0
319	STEPHANOPOULOS	Who represents the extreme on this stage?	0
320	KLOBUCHAR	I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals up here, George, so I'm talking about...	0
321	STEPHANOPOULOS	Which ones?	0
322	KLOBUCHAR	If I could -- if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends.	0
323	KLOBUCHAR	First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals.	0
324	KLOBUCHAR	That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada.	0
325	KLOBUCHAR	We have worked to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that's a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare.	0
326	KLOBUCHAR	I figure that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.	0
327	KLOBUCHAR	But when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor's creed, which is, do no harm.	0
328	KLOBUCHAR	And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill.	0
329	KLOBUCHAR	And on page eight -- on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.	0
330	KLOBUCHAR	And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.	0
331	KLOBUCHAR	That's in four years.	0
332	KLOBUCHAR	I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea.	0
333	KLOBUCHAR	And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.	0
334	KLOBUCHAR	And that is a public option.	0
335	KLOBUCHAR	A non-profit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 million more people.	0
336	KLOBUCHAR	That is a bold idea.	0
337	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
338	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Warren, page eight of the bill, she says, 149 people will lose their health insurance.	0
339	WARREN	I'm sorry.	0
340	STEPHANOPOULOS	She said, page eight of the bill, 149 million people will lose their health insurance.	0
341	KLOBUCHAR	Current health insurance.	0
342	BIDEN	One hundred forty-nine million.	0
343	STEPHANOPOULOS	Million, excuse me.	0
344	WARREN	So let's be clear about this.	0
345	WARREN	People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals.	0
346	WARREN	Doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms.	0
347	WARREN	They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies.	0
348	WARREN	People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles.	0
349	WARREN	What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country.	0
350	WARREN	Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system.	0
351	WARREN	How did they make that money?	0
352	WARREN	Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.	0
353	STEPHANOPOULOS	Mayor Buttigieg?	0
354	BUTTIGIEG	The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people.	0
355	BUTTIGIEG	I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you.	0
356	BUTTIGIEG	Not my way or the highway.	0
357	BUTTIGIEG	Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA.	0
358	BUTTIGIEG	I propose Medicare for all who want it.	0
359	BUTTIGIEG	We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we're right, as progressives, that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves.	0
360	BUTTIGIEG	I trust the American people to make the right choice for them.	0
361	BUTTIGIEG	Why don't you?	0
362	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.	0
363	SANDERS	George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance?	0
364	SANDERS	Fifty million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy.	1
365	SANDERS	Medicare for All is comprehensive health care.	0
366	SANDERS	Covers all basic needs, including home health care.	0
367	SANDERS	It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not.	0
368	SANDERS	So, if you want comprehensive health care, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is the way to go.	0
369	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
370	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Harris, you startled out co-sponsoring Senator Sanders's bill, you now say you're uncomfortable with it.	0
371	STEPHANOPOULOS	Why?	0
372	HARRIS	I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far.	0
373	HARRIS	We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.	0
374	HARRIS	I want to give credit to Bernie.	0
375	HARRIS	Take credit, Bernie.	0
376	HARRIS	You know, you brought us this far on Medicare for All.	0
377	HARRIS	I support Medicare for All, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did.	0
378	HARRIS	Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them.	0
379	HARRIS	So, under my Medicare for all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that's what people want.	0
380	HARRIS	And I agree, we shouldn't take choice from people.	0
381	HARRIS	But here's the thing.	0
382	HARRIS	Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage.	0
383	HARRIS	But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.	0
384	HARRIS	So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
385	HARRIS	We all fought against it.	0
386	HARRIS	And then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o'clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country.	0
387	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
388	HARRIS	Fast forward to today, and what is happening?	0
389	HARRIS	Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
390	HARRIS	Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage.	0
391	HARRIS	Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans.	0
392	HARRIS	And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache.	0
393	HARRIS	What they want to know is that they're going to have health care and cost will not be a barrier to getting it.	0
394	HARRIS	But let's focus on the end goal.	0
395	HARRIS	If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.	0
396	BIDEN	George, 15 seconds?	0
397	BIDEN	Fifteen seconds?	0
398	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
399	STEPHANOPOULOS	Let me get to Congressman O'Rourke and then bring you -- go ahead, Mr. Vice President.	0
400	BIDEN	Fifteen seconds.	0
401	BIDEN	Look, everybody says we want an option.	0
402	BIDEN	The option I'm proposing is Medicare for all -- Medicare for choice.	0
403	BIDEN	If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance -- from your employer, you automatically can buy into this.	0
404	BIDEN	You don't have -- no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in.	0
405	BIDEN	You get covered, period.	0
406	BIDEN	And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer.	0
407	BIDEN	I hear this large savings, the president thinks -- my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer's going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance.	0
408	BIDEN	They're going to give back that money to the employee?	0
409	SANDERS	As a matter of fact, they will in our bill.	0
410	BIDEN	Well, let me tell you something.	0
411	BIDEN	For a socialist, you've got -- for a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.	0
412	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Sanders?	0
413	SANDERS	OK, one minute, George?	0
414	STEPHANOPOULOS	Go ahead.	0
415	SANDERS	All right.	0
416	SANDERS	Two points.	0
417	SANDERS	You got to defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt.	0
418	SANDERS	You know why they're going bankrupt?	0
419	SANDERS	Because they suffered a terrible disease -- cancer or heart disease.	0
420	SANDERS	Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer.	0
421	SANDERS	And our program is the only one that does that.	0
422	BIDEN	I know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something.	0
423	BIDEN	It's personal to me.	0
424	BIDEN	Let me tell you something.	0
425	BIDEN	Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan.	0
426	BIDEN	They will not go bankrupt because of that.	0
427	BIDEN	They will not go bankrupt because of that.	0
428	BIDEN	They can join immediately.	0
429	BIDEN	And we're talking four, six, eight, ten years, depending on who you talk about, before we get to Medicare for all.	0
430	BIDEN	Come on.	0
431	BIDEN	I've been there.	0
432	BIDEN	You've been there.	0
433	BIDEN	You know what it's like.	0
434	BIDEN	People need help now, hope now, and do something now.	0
435	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
436	STEPHANOPOULOS	Congressman O'Rourke?	0
437	O'ROURKE	Yeah.	0
438	O'ROURKE	Thank you.	0
439	O'ROURKE	Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now.	0
440	O'ROURKE	But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions uninsured and uncared for.	0
441	O'ROURKE	In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better.	0
442	O'ROURKE	In my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare.	0
443	O'ROURKE	Everyone who's insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare.	0
444	O'ROURKE	And those, like members of unions who've fought for the health care plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them.	0
445	O'ROURKE	This is the best possible path forward.	0
446	BIDEN	You just described my plan (ph).	0
447	STEPHANOPOULOS	This is -- health care is the top issue for everyone in the country.	0
448	STEPHANOPOULOS	I want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond.	0
449	STEPHANOPOULOS	So, Secretary Castro, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you will get a minute.	0
450	CASTRO	Thank you.	0
451	CASTRO	And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this.	0
452	CASTRO	And, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama.	0
453	CASTRO	Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.	0
454	CASTRO	Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn't true, when Senator Harris brought that up.	0
455	CASTRO	There was a fact check of that, and they said that was true.	0
456	CASTRO	You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse.	0
457	CASTRO	But that whole time, she had Medicare.	0
458	CASTRO	I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available.	0
459	CASTRO	If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do.	0
460	CASTRO	But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in.	1
461	CASTRO	They would automatically be enrolled.	1
462	CASTRO	They wouldn't have a buy in.	1
463	CASTRO	That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered.	0
464	CASTRO	He wanted every single person in this country covered.	0
465	CASTRO	My plan would do that.	0
466	CASTRO	Your plan would not.	0
467	BIDEN	They do not have to buy in.	0
468	BIDEN	They do not have to buy in.	0
469	CASTRO	You just said that.	0
470	CASTRO	You just said that two minutes ago.	0
471	CASTRO	You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.	0
472	BIDEN	Do not have to buy in if you can't afford it.	0
473	CASTRO	You said they would have to buy in.	0
474	BIDEN	Your grandmother would not have to buy in.	0
475	BIDEN	If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled.	0
476	CASTRO	Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?	0
477	CASTRO	Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?	0
478	CASTRO	I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in.	0
479	CASTRO	You're forgetting that.	0
480	BIDEN	I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money.	0
481	CASTRO	I mean, look, look, we need a health care system...	0
482	BIDEN	She -- you're automatically enrolled.	0
483	CASTRO	It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not.	0
484	CASTRO	If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you.	0
485	CASTRO	You would have to opt in.	0
486	CASTRO	My health care plan would.	0
487	CASTRO	That's a big difference.	0
488	CASTRO	I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.	0
489	BIDEN	That'll be a surprise to him.	0
490	STEPHANOPOULOS	Andrew Yang?	0
491	YANG	Come on, guys.	0
492	BUTTIGIEG	This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.	0
493	KLOBUCHAR	Yeah.	0
494	BUTTIGIEG	This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that -- my plan, your plan.	0
495	BUTTIGIEG	Look, we all have different visions for what is better...	0
496	CASTRO	Yeah, that's called the Democratic primary election, Pete.	0
497	CASTRO	That's called an election.	0
498	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
499	CASTRO	That's an election.	0
500	CASTRO	You know?	0
501	CASTRO	This is what we're here for.	0
502	CASTRO	It's an election.	0
503	KLOBUCHAR	Yes, but a house -- a house divided cannot stand.	0
504	KLOBUCHAR	And that is not how we're going to win this.	0
505	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
506	YANG	Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team here.	0
507	YANG	We know we're on the same team.	0
508	YANG	We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.	0
509	YANG	And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way.	0
510	YANG	As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees.	0
511	YANG	You instead pretend their contractors.	0
512	YANG	It's harder to change jobs.	0
513	YANG	It's certainly harder to start a business.	0
514	YANG	The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.	0
515	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
516	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Booker...	0
517	YANG	Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy.	0
518	YANG	We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the health care system.	0
519	YANG	And the Cleveland Clinic, where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe -- shocker -- they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves.	0
520	YANG	That is the pitch to the American people.	0
521	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Booker, close out this discussion.	0
522	BOOKER	Thank you very much.	0
523	BOOKER	Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis.	0
524	BOOKER	They don't have health insurance.	0
525	BOOKER	Their health insurance doesn't go far enough.	0
526	BOOKER	They can't afford their prescription drugs.	0
527	BOOKER	Look, I'm clear in what I believe.	0
528	BOOKER	I believe in Medicare for all.	0
529	BOOKER	I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system.	0
530	BOOKER	But dear God, I know every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions.	0
531	BOOKER	And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation.	0
532	BOOKER	Everybody feels it.	0
533	BOOKER	And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now.	0
534	BOOKER	They have high blood pressure right now.	0
535	BOOKER	They have unaffordable insulin right now.	0
536	BOOKER	And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.	0
537	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
538	BOOKER	And we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other.	0
539	BOOKER	We can walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
540	BOOKER	If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans.	0
541	BOOKER	But every single day, I'll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.	0
542	STEPHANOPOULOS	Candidates, thank you.	0
543	STEPHANOPOULOS	Linsey Davis?	0
544	DAVIS	Thanks, George.	0
545	DAVIS	Since we're here at an HBCU, I'd like to start with young black voters.	0
546	DAVIS	Several recent polls indicate their number-one concern is racism.	0
547	DAVIS	This campus, this state, and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on Latinos in El Paso.	0
548	DAVIS	Now, we know that the racial divide started long before President Trump and President Obama, but each of you on this stage has said that President Trump has made that divide worse.	0
549	DAVIS	Congressman O'Rourke, coming to you first, why are you the most qualified candidate to address this divide?	0
550	O'ROURKE	You know, I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then.	0
551	O'ROURKE	And I was talking about it long before then, as well.	0
552	O'ROURKE	Racism in America is endemic.	0
553	O'ROURKE	It is foundational.	0
554	O'ROURKE	We can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African...	0
555	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
556	O'ROURKE	... was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy.	0
557	O'ROURKE	We have to be able to answer this challenge.	0
558	O'ROURKE	And it is found in our education system, where in Texas, a 5-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin.	0
559	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
560	O'ROURKE	In our health care system, where there's a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there's 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America.	0
561	O'ROURKE	I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundation.	0
562	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
563	O'ROURKE	But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.	0
564	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
565	DAVIS	Secretary Castro, 45 seconds to respond.	0
566	CASTRO	Look, you know, I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso.	0
567	CASTRO	He's done a great job with that.	0
568	CASTRO	Look, a few weeks ago, a shooter drove 10 miles inspired by this -- 10 hours inspired by this president to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family.	0
569	CASTRO	White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out.	0
570	CASTRO	I'm proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate.	0
571	CASTRO	I'm also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we're not going to have any more Laquan McDonalds or Eric Garners or Michael Browns or Pamela Turners or Walter Scotts or Sandra Bland, here from the Houston area.	0
572	CASTRO	We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart.	0
573	CASTRO	They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that.	0
574	DAVIS	Senator Booker, you have said, quote, "The real question isn't who is or isn't a racist.	0
575	DAVIS	It's who is going to do something about it."	0
576	DAVIS	Senator, what do you plan to do about it?	0
577	BOOKER	Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that.	0
578	BOOKER	Racism exists.	0
579	BOOKER	The question isn't who isn't a racist.	0
580	BOOKER	It's who is and isn't doing something about racism.	0
581	BOOKER	And this is not just an issue that started yesterday.	0
582	BOOKER	It's not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy.	0
583	BOOKER	We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system.	0
584	BOOKER	And it's nice to go all the way back to slavery, but dear God, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850.	1
585	BOOKER	We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out, and having a plan to do something about it.	0
586	BOOKER	If I am president of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes.	0
587	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
588	BOOKER	And we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans, from criminal justice reform to the disparities in health care to even one that we don't talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.	0
589	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
590	DAVIS	Mayor Buttigieg, you've been struggling with issues around race in your own community.	0
591	DAVIS	You've also said that anyone who votes to re-elect President Trump is, at best, looking the other way on racism.	0
592	DAVIS	Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?	0
593	BUTTIGIEG	I believe what's deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a chance to change all of that.	0
594	BUTTIGIEG	Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us.	0
595	BUTTIGIEG	That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it.	0
596	BUTTIGIEG	It's -- it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own.	0
597	BUTTIGIEG	Harms compound.	0
598	BUTTIGIEG	In the same way that a dollar saved compounds, so does a dollar stolen.	0
599	BUTTIGIEG	And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.	0
600	BUTTIGIEG	I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the overincarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25 percent...	0
601	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
602	BUTTIGIEG	... the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses, investing in HBCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs.	0
603	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
604	BUTTIGIEG	We can and must do that.	0
605	BUTTIGIEG	But that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker.	0
606	BUTTIGIEG	Because when I -- where I come from, a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three.	0
607	BUTTIGIEG	We've got to say that...	0
608	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
609	BUTTIGIEG	... and bring people together.	0
610	DAVIS	Also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform.	0
611	DAVIS	Senator Harris, you released your plan for that just this week.	0
612	DAVIS	And it does contradict some of your prior positions.	0
613	DAVIS	Among them, you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don't.	0
614	DAVIS	You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don't.	0
615	DAVIS	You've said that you changed on these and other things because you were, quote, "swimming against the current, and thankfully the currents have changed."	0
616	DAVIS	But when you had the power, why didn't you try to effect change then?	0
617	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (ph)	0
618	HARRIS	So, there have been -- there have been -- I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record.	0
619	HARRIS	Let me be very clear.	0
620	HARRIS	I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons.	0
621	HARRIS	One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe.	0
622	HARRIS	And second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias.	0
623	HARRIS	And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had.	0
624	HARRIS	But I made a decision that, if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside.	0
625	HARRIS	And so I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs.	0
626	HARRIS	I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.	0
627	HARRIS	I created one of the first in the nation trainings for a police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.	0
628	HARRIS	Was I able to get enough done?	0
629	HARRIS	Absolutely not.	0
630	HARRIS	But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system.	0
631	HARRIS	I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one.	0
632	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
633	HARRIS	It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable.	0
634	HARRIS	And finally, my plan is about making sure that, in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact.	0
635	HARRIS	And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.	0
636	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
637	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
638	DAVIS	Senator Klobuchar, during your eight years as a prosecutor in Minnesota, there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police.	0
639	DAVIS	Critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases.	0
640	DAVIS	The ACLU's legal director in Minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice.	0
641	DAVIS	Do you wish now that you had done more?	0
642	KLOBUCHAR	That's not my record.	0
643	SYSTEM	(inaudible)	0
644	KLOBUCHAR	We are here at a historically black college.	0
645	KLOBUCHAR	And I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said.	0
646	KLOBUCHAR	She said, "What the people want is simple; they want a country as good as its promise."	0
647	KLOBUCHAR	And that same can be said of the criminal justice system.	0
648	KLOBUCHAR	So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them.	0
649	KLOBUCHAR	I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis.	0
650	KLOBUCHAR	But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury.	0
651	KLOBUCHAR	That's how they were all handled across our state.	0
652	KLOBUCHAR	I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself.	0
653	KLOBUCHAR	That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office.	0
654	KLOBUCHAR	The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids.	0
655	KLOBUCHAR	There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch.	0
656	KLOBUCHAR	No one had bothered to figure out who did it.	0
657	KLOBUCHAR	When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups; we put up billboards; we found the shooter and we put him in jail.	0
658	KLOBUCHAR	We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.	0
659	KLOBUCHAR	What changes did we make?	0
660	KLOBUCHAR	Go after white-collar crimes in a big way, diversity the office in a big way, work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID.	0
661	KLOBUCHAR	And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90 percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.	0
662	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
663	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
664	DAVIS	You all believe that the war on drugs has put too many Americans behind bars.	0
665	DAVIS	Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison.	0
666	DAVIS	Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough.	0
667	DAVIS	Your response?	0
668	BIDEN	Well, first of all, let me say that, when I came back from law school, I had a job with a great -- a big-time law firm.	0
669	BIDEN	I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated.	0
670	BIDEN	We were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months.	0
671	BIDEN	I've been involved from the beginning.	0
672	BIDEN	As a young congressman -- as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood.	0
673	BIDEN	I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate, et cetera.	0
674	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail.	0
675	BIDEN	The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change.	0
676	BIDEN	We should be talking about rehabilitation.	0
677	BIDEN	Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.	0
678	BIDEN	As -- when we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system.	0
679	BIDEN	Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem.	0
680	BIDEN	They should be going directly to a rehabilitation.	0
681	BIDEN	We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.	0
682	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
683	BIDEN	We -- I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system.	0
684	BIDEN	And so we have to change the whole way we look at this.	0
685	BIDEN	When we put people in prison, we have to equip them that when they get out -- nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released -- they shouldn't be in there; that should be a misdemeanor.	0
686	BIDEN	They should be out and their record should be expunged.	0
687	BIDEN	Every single right should be returned.	0
688	BIDEN	When you finish your term in prison, you should be able not only to vote but have access to Pell grants, have access to be able to get housing...	0
689	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
690	BIDEN	... have access to be able to move along the way.	0
691	BIDEN	I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines.	0
692	BIDEN	And the fact is, we've learned so much more more...	0
693	DAVIS	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
694	BIDEN	Thank you.	0
695	DAVIS	Senator Booker, 45 seconds to respond.	0
696	BOOKER	Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken.	0
697	BOOKER	There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs.	0
698	BOOKER	But if you are African-American, you are almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives.	0
699	BOOKER	And so much of this comes down to privilege.	0
700	BOOKER	We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson (ph) says treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.	0
701	BOOKER	And so I have challenged this whole field.	0
702	BOOKER	We can specifically and demonstrably now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say, when we are president of the United States; when I am president of the United States, we will release them.	0
703	BOOKER	And let me be specific.	0
704	BOOKER	I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail.	0
705	BOOKER	If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long, and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now.	0
706	BOOKER	Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people.	0
707	BOOKER	And I challenge you.	0
708	BOOKER	Don't just say a big statement; back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom.	0
709	BOOKER	We need to reform this system and we must do it now.	0
710	BOOKER	Every day we wait is too long.	0
711	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator Booker.	0
712	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
713	DAVIS	David?	0
714	MUIR	Thank you, Linsey.	0
715	MUIR	I want to turn to the deadly mass shootings here in this country.	0
716	MUIR	And of course we are all mindful tonight of where we stand.	0
717	MUIR	We are here in Texas tonight, where 29 people have lost their lives in just the last month alone, El Paso, which we've discussed; in Odessa.	0
718	MUIR	And I know there are survivors from El Paso right here in the hall tonight.	0
719	MUIR	Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you, because we all remember Sandy Hook.	0
720	MUIR	Twenty-six people died in that school, 20 of them children.	0
721	MUIR	Those first graders would be in eighth grade today.	0
722	MUIR	At the time, there was a groundswell in this country to get something done.	0
723	MUIR	President Obama asked you to lead the push for gun control.	0
724	MUIR	You have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, but four months after Sandy Hook, a measure to require expanded background checks died on the Senate floor.	0
725	MUIR	If you couldn't get it done after Sandy Hook, why should voters give you another chance?	0
726	BIDEN	Because I got it done before.	0
727	BIDEN	I'm the only one up here that's ever beat the NRA --only one ever to beat the NRA nationally.	0
728	BIDEN	I'm the guy that brought the Brady bill into -- into focus and became law.	0
729	BIDEN	And so that's number one.	0
730	BIDEN	Number two, after Sandy Hook, a number of things happened.	0
731	BIDEN	It went from a cause to a movement.	0
732	BIDEN	Look what's happened now.	0
733	BIDEN	Mothers -- the organization -- mothers against violence -- gun violence.	0
734	BIDEN	We've seen what's happened again.	0
735	BIDEN	Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change.	0
736	BIDEN	There has been a sea change.	0
737	BIDEN	Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50 percent of gun -- of gun -- of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them.	0
738	BIDEN	Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct.	0
739	BIDEN	Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street -- period.	1
740	BIDEN	And we have to get buy-backs and get them out of their basements.	0
741	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
742	BIDEN	So the point is, things have changed.	0
743	BIDEN	And things have changed a lot.	0
744	BIDEN	And now what's happening is -- and, by the way, the way Beto handled -- excuse me for saying Beto.	0
745	BIDEN	What the congressman...	0
746	O'ROURKE	That's all right.	0
747	O'ROURKE	Beto's good.	0
748	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
749	BIDEN	The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful, to look in the eyes of those people, to see those kids...	0
750	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
751	BIDEN	... to understand those parents, you understand the heartache.	0
752	(UNKNOWN)	But this is the problem.	0
753	BIDEN	We are ready to do this.	0
754	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
755	MUIR	Mr. Vice President...	0
756	(UNKNOWN)	This is the problem.	0
757	O'ROURKE	Thank you.	0
758	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
759	MUIR	... you did bring up assault weapons here.	0
760	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
761	MUIR	You did bring up assault weapons here, and many of you on this stage have talked about executive order.	0
762	MUIR	Senator Harris, you have said that you would take executive action on guns within your first 100 days...	0
763	HARRIS	Correct.	0
764	MUIR	... including banning imports of AR-15 assault weapons.	0
765	HARRIS	That's right.	0
766	MUIR	President Obama, after Sandy Hook, more than 23 executive actions, and yet here we all are today.	0
767	MUIR	In recent days former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, "Some really talented people are seeking the nomination.	0
768	MUIR	They said 'I'm going to issue an executive order.'"	0
769	MUIR	Biden saying, "There's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say 'I'm going to eliminate assault weapons,'" saying, "you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order."	0
770	MUIR	Does the vice president have a point there?	0
771	BIDEN	Some things you can.	0
772	BIDEN	Many things you can't.	0
773	MUIR	Let's let the senator answer.	0
774	HARRIS	Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.	0
775	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
776	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
777	BIDEN	Let's be constitutional.	0
778	BIDEN	We've got a Constitution.	0
779	HARRIS	And yes, we can, because I'll tell you something.	0
780	HARRIS	The way that I think about this is, I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.	0
781	HARRIS	I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you.	0
782	HARRIS	I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.	0
783	HARRIS	And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing, to act, is just -- it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.	0
784	HARRIS	I was talking about this at one of my town halls, and -- and this child who was eight years old, probably, came up to me -- it was like it was a secret between the two of us, and he tugged on my jacket and he said, "I had to have one of those drills."	0
785	HARRIS	It is traumatizing our children.	0
786	HARRIS	El Paso -- and, Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.	0
787	HARRIS	You know, people asked me...	0
788	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
789	HARRIS	... in El Paso -- they said, you know, because I have a long-standing record on this issue.	0
790	HARRIS	They said, "Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?"	0
791	HARRIS	And I said, "Well, look, I mean, obviously, he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition."	0
792	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
793	MUIR	Senator Harris, thank you.	0
794	MUIR	Vice President Biden, do you still stand by what you said on an executive order?	0
795	BIDEN	No, what I said was -- the question -- speak to constitutional scholars.	0
796	BIDEN	If in fact we could say, "By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period; they cannot be sold anymore" -- check with constitutional scholars.	0
797	BIDEN	Now, you can say...	0
798	MUIR	Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
799	MUIR	Congressman O'Rourke, I want to get to you on this.	0
800	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
801	HARRIS	John, could I tell you what you could do in 100 days?	0
802	MUIR	I'm going to -- I'm going to work down the row here.	0
803	MUIR	But I do want to come to Congressman O'Rourke, because I know this is personal to you.	0
804	MUIR	El Paso is your hometown.	0
805	MUIR	Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country.	0
806	MUIR	You've gone further.	0
807	MUIR	You've said, quote, "Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them."	0
808	MUIR	You know that critics call this confiscation.	0
809	MUIR	Are you proposing taking away their guns?	0
810	MUIR	And how would this work?	0
811	O'ROURKE	I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield...	0
812	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
813	O'ROURKE	If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.	0
814	O'ROURKE	When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.	0
815	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
816	O'ROURKE	We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.	0
817	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
818	MUIR	Congressman, thank you.	0
819	O'ROURKE	And I want to say this.	0
820	O'ROURKE	I'm listening to the people of this country.	0
821	O'ROURKE	The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-15s and AK-47s and those who were buying those weapons.	0
822	O'ROURKE	And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there, folks who said, I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself.	0
823	O'ROURKE	It is a weapon of war.	0
824	O'ROURKE	So, let's do the right thing, but let's bring everyone in America into the conversation, Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, and non-gun owners alike.	0
825	(UNKNOWN)	May I make a point?	0
826	MUIR	Congressman, thank you.	0
827	MUIR	I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar on this, because you've often talked about your uncle and the proud hunters back home in Minnesota.	0
828	MUIR	So I wanted to get your response to Congressman O'Rourke tonight.	0
829	MUIR	Where do you stand on mandatory gun buybacks?	0
830	KLOBUCHAR	I so appreciate what the congressman's been doing.	0
831	KLOBUCHAR	And I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.	0
832	KLOBUCHAR	Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.	0
833	KLOBUCHAR	Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store, where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage.	0
834	KLOBUCHAR	And certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds, one man guns down innocent people.	0
835	KLOBUCHAR	The cops got there in one minute, and it still wasn't enough to save those people.	0
836	KLOBUCHAR	That's what unites us.	0
837	KLOBUCHAR	You know what else unites us?	0
838	KLOBUCHAR	And I'll tell you this.	0
839	KLOBUCHAR	What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell's desk, are three bills -- universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-47s.	0
840	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
841	MUIR	Senator Klobuchar?	0
842	KLOBUCHAR	So if we want to get something done -- and I personally think we should start with a voluntary buyback program.	0
843	KLOBUCHAR	That's what I think, David.	0
844	KLOBUCHAR	But I want to finish this, because if you want action now, if you want action now, we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell.	0
845	KLOBUCHAR	We can't wait until one of us gets in the White House.	0
846	KLOBUCHAR	We have to pass those bills right now to get this done.	0
847	MUIR	Senator Klobuchar...	0
848	KLOBUCHAR	Because we cannot spare another innocent life.	0
849	MUIR	Thank you.	0
850	MUIR	Thank you.	0
851	MUIR	I want to turn to Senator Booker, because you have said just this week about guns and about the candidates on this stage, that the differences do matter.	0
852	MUIR	Those were your words.	0
853	MUIR	You have argued, if you need a license to drive a car in this country, you should have a license to buy a gun.	0
854	MUIR	Gun-owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun.	0
855	MUIR	This would require, as you know, Congress to pass legislation.	0
856	MUIR	If Democrats can't get universal background checks, how would you get this done?	0
857	MUIR	And can you name one Republican colleague of yours in the Senate right now who would be onboard with this idea?	0
858	BOOKER	So, background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans.	0
859	BOOKER	Eighty-three percent of Americans agree with licensing.	0
860	BOOKER	This is the issue.	0
861	BOOKER	Look, I grew up in the suburbs.	0
862	BOOKER	It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting.	0
863	BOOKER	It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me.	0
864	BOOKER	It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing.	0
865	BOOKER	And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing.	0
866	BOOKER	But this is what I'm sorry about.	0
867	BOOKER	I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change.	0
868	BOOKER	This is a crisis of empathy in our nation.	0
869	BOOKER	We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.	0
870	BOOKER	You want to know how we get this done?	0
871	BOOKER	We get this done by having a more courageous empathy, where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities.	0
872	BOOKER	They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.	0
873	BOOKER	I will lead change on this issue, because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget, national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine.	0
874	BOOKER	Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue.	0
875	BOOKER	I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.	0
876	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
877	MUIR	Senator Booker, thank you.	0
878	MUIR	A quick follow-up, though, because Americans watching tonight know the reality of Congress in Washington.	0
879	MUIR	I asked do you have a Republican colleague in the Senate who would be onboard with this idea to get this done?	0
880	BOOKER	You know, if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement.	0
881	BOOKER	The number-one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry.	0
882	BOOKER	Think about this.	0
883	BOOKER	We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined, from the Revolutionary War until now.	0
884	BOOKER	This is not a side issue to me.	0
885	BOOKER	It is a central issue to me.	0
886	BOOKER	That is the kind of fight -- because the majority of homicide victims -- we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine.	0
887	BOOKER	We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency.	0
888	BOOKER	Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun-owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby.	0
889	BOOKER	It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.	0
890	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
891	BIDEN	Go beat them (ph).	0
892	MUIR	Senator Booker, thank you.	0
893	MUIR	Senator Warren, I want to come to you next, because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with Republicans in the Senate.	0
894	MUIR	What can you get done on gun control?	0
895	WARREN	So let's start by framing the problem the right way.	0
896	WARREN	We have a gun violence problem in this country.	0
897	WARREN	The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines.	0
898	WARREN	Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds.	0
899	WARREN	People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse.	0
900	WARREN	We have a gun violence problem in this country.	0
901	WARREN	And we agree on many steps we could take to fix it.	0
902	WARREN	My view on this is, we're going to -- it's not going to be one and done on this.	0
903	WARREN	We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly.	0
904	WARREN	But here's the deal.	0
905	WARREN	The question we need to ask is, when we've got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do -- I like registration -- want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets, why doesn't it happen?	0
906	WARREN	And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.	0
907	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
908	WARREN	We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry.	0
909	WARREN	And unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns.	0
910	WARREN	I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.	1
911	WARREN	Until we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country.	0
912	WARREN	We've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people.	0
913	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
914	MUIR	Senator Warren, thank you.	0
915	MUIR	You bring up eliminating the filibuster, which means you would need simply a simple majority in a Republican Senate to get something done.	0
916	MUIR	I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this, because you've said before of this, if Donald Trump supports ending the filibuster, which he's talked about himself, you should be nervous.	0
917	MUIR	Would you support ending the filibuster?	0
918	SANDERS	No.	0
919	SANDERS	But what I would support, absolutely, is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about, Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet.	0
920	SANDERS	I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen, and you can do it in a variety of ways.	0
921	SANDERS	You can do that through budget reconciliation law.	0
922	SANDERS	You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is in order and what is not.	0
923	SANDERS	But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system, and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or, in this case, you've got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership.	0
924	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
925	SANDERS	I am proud -- I am proud that, year after year, I had an "F" rating from the NRA.	0
926	SANDERS	And as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.	0
927	MUIR	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
928	HARRIS	May I respond...	0
929	RAMOS	We've been hearing a lot about what's been happening here in Texas.	0
930	RAMOS	Only a few weeks ago, the deadliest massacre of Latinos, Latinos, in modern U.S. history happened in this state, in El Paso.	0
931	RAMOS	So the fear among Latinos -- and you know this -- is very real.	0
932	RAMOS	So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country: immigration.	0
933	RAMOS	Vice President Biden, as a presidential candidate, in 2008, you supported the border wall, saying, "Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence."	0
934	RAMOS	This is what you said.	0
935	RAMOS	Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in U.S. history.	0
936	RAMOS	Did you do anything to prevent those deportations?	0
937	RAMOS	I mean, you've been asked this question before and refused to answer, so let me try once again.	0
938	RAMOS	Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations?	0
939	RAMOS	Why should Latinos trust you?	0
940	BIDEN	What Latinos should look at is -- comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one.	0
941	BIDEN	We didn't lock people up in cages.	1
942	BIDEN	We didn't separate families.	1
943	BIDEN	We didn't do all of those things, number one.	0
944	BIDEN	Number two -- number two, by the time -- this is a president who came along with the DACA program.	0
945	BIDEN	No one had ever done that before.	0
946	BIDEN	This is the president that sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America.	0
947	BIDEN	This is a president who's done a great deal.	0
948	BIDEN	So I'm proud to have served with him.	0
949	BIDEN	What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.	0
950	BIDEN	I would, in fact, make sure that there is -- we immediately surge to the border.	0
951	BIDEN	All those people who are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard.	0
952	BIDEN	That's who we are.	0
953	BIDEN	We're a nation who says, if you want to flee, and you're freeing oppression, you should come.	0
954	BIDEN	I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.	0
955	BIDEN	And by the way, retrospectively, you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up.	0
956	BIDEN	The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it.	0
957	BIDEN	Let's put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act.	0
958	BIDEN	Now (inaudible) back...	0
959	RAMOS	Yeah, but you didn't answer the question.	0
960	BIDEN	Well, I did answer the question.	0
961	RAMOS	No, did you make a mistake with those deportations?	0
962	BIDEN	The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.	0
963	RAMOS	How about you?	0
964	BIDEN	I'm the vice president of the United States.	0
965	RAMOS	Secretary Castro, would you want to respond to Vice President Biden?	0
966	CASTRO	I mean, look...	0
967	RAMOS	And let me put this in context, because your party controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and didn't pass immigration reform, and this broke a promise made by President Barack Obama to Latinos.	0
968	RAMOS	So why should voters trust Democrats now?	0
969	RAMOS	I mean, now it is even more difficult, as you know, because you need Republican votes in the Senate.	0
970	RAMOS	So are you willing, for instance, to give up DACA or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize 10.5 million undocumented immigrants?	0
971	CASTRO	Jorge, thank you very much for that question.	0
972	CASTRO	And, look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump.	0
973	CASTRO	Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants.	0
974	CASTRO	He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that's very different from Barack Obama.	0
975	CASTRO	But my problem with Vice President Biden -- and Cory pointed this out last time -- is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too, and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, well, that was the president.	0
976	CASTRO	I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions.	0
977	CASTRO	I mean...	0
978	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
979	RAMOS	Vice President Biden, you have -- you have 45 seconds.	0
980	CASTRO	Let me just say...	0
981	BIDEN	That's not what I said.	0
982	CASTRO	Let me just say...	0
983	BIDEN	That's not what I said.	0
984	CASTRO	Jorge, let me just say that I would -- I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan.	0
985	CASTRO	You know why?	0
986	CASTRO	Because I'm not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue.	0
987	CASTRO	I'm not going to back pedal.	0
988	CASTRO	I'm not going to pretend like I don't have my own vision for immigration.	0
989	CASTRO	So we're not going to give up DACA.	0
990	CASTRO	We're not going to give up protections for anybody.	0
991	CASTRO	I believe that on January 20, 2021, we're going to have a Democratic president, we're going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House, and we're going to pass immigration reform within the first 100 days.	0
992	RAMOS	Vice President, 45 seconds.	0
993	BIDEN	I did not say I don't -- I stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent.	0
994	BIDEN	That's where I stand.	0
995	BIDEN	I did not say I did not stand with him.	0
996	RAMOS	OK, Senator Warren, hundreds of children have been separated from their parents at the border.	0
997	RAMOS	And recently, in Mississippi, we saw the largest immigration raid in a decade.	0
998	RAMOS	You want ICE, the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants.	0
999	RAMOS	So how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrive legally but overstay their visas?	0
1000	RAMOS	And how would you stop hundreds of thousands of Central Americans who want to migrate to the U.S.?	0
1001	WARREN	Well, I start with a statement of principles, and that is, in this country, immigration does not make us weaker, immigration makes us stronger.	0
1002	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1003	WARREN	I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our DREAMers, but also for their grandparents, and for their cousins, for people who have overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields.	0
1004	WARREN	I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable.	0
1005	WARREN	Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely.	0
1006	WARREN	A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer, and it is not serving our values.	0
1007	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1008	RAMOS	Mr. Yang...	0
1009	WARREN	We need -- I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces.	0
1010	WARREN	Why do we have a crisis at the border?	0
1011	WARREN	In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering.	0
1012	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1013	WARREN	We need to restore that help.	0
1014	WARREN	We need to help establish and re-establish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives.	0
1015	WARREN	We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically.	0
1016	WARREN	We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back.	0
1017	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1018	RAMOS	Mr. Yang?	0
1019	RAMOS	It is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe anti-immigrant measures, from putting kids in cages to limiting asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence.	0
1020	RAMOS	But it is also true about 1 million immigrants enter the U.S. legally every year.	0
1021	RAMOS	So, are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from 1 million to 2 million per year?	0
1022	RAMOS	And should there be a merit system, as President Trump wants?	0
1023	WARREN	So, yes -- oh, I'm sorry.	0
1024	WARREN	Did you me or...	0
1025	YANG	It was me.	0
1026	WARREN	Oh, he said it.	0
1027	WARREN	OK.	0
1028	WARREN	Sorry.	0
1029	YANG	My -- my father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor and now his son is running for president.	0
1030	YANG	That is the immigration story that we have...	0
1031	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1032	YANG	... to be able to share with the American people.	0
1033	YANG	If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants.	0
1034	YANG	And rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities.	0
1035	YANG	We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism, and I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration.	0
1036	YANG	I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways.	0
1037	YANG	He says, build a wall.	0
1038	YANG	I'm going to say to immigrants, come to America, because if you come here, your son our daughter can run for president.	0
1039	YANG	The water is great.	0
1040	YANG	And this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.	0
1041	YANG	This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations.	0
1042	YANG	If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success.	0
1043	YANG	And that is where I would lead as president.	0

1046	BUTTIGIEG	Gracias.	0
1047	RAMOS	(INAUDIBLE) Pete, eight out of 10 Latinos in Texas for another mass shooter targeting them.	0
1048	RAMOS	This is according to a new Univision poll.	0
1049	RAMOS	President Trump has called Mexican immigrants rapists and killers, tried to ban Muslims from entering the country separated children from their parents.	0
1050	RAMOS	He supporters have chanted, build a wall and send her back.	0
1051	RAMOS	Do you think that people who support President Trump and his immigration policies are racist?	0

1054	SYSTEM	(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
1055	BUTTIGIEG	The only people, though, who actually buy into this president's hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don't know any.	0
1056	BUTTIGIEG	We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform.	0
1057	BUTTIGIEG	In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went into ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him.	0
1058	BUTTIGIEG	In some of the most conservative, rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow.	0
1059	BUTTIGIEG	And that's why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city.	0
1060	BUTTIGIEG	You know, the only reason that South Bend is growing right now, after years of shrinking, is immigration.	0
1061	BUTTIGIEG	It's one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington, to create city-issued municipal IDs, so that people, regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.	0
1062	BUTTIGIEG	We have an opportunity to actually get something done.	0
1063	BUTTIGIEG	But we cannot allow this continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s.	0
1064	BUTTIGIEG	We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values.	0
1065	BUTTIGIEG	Values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws.	0
1066	SYSTEM	(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
1067	RAMOS	In an interview eight months ago, you were asked to asked what to do with the so-called "over-stayers," people who come with a visa and then stay.	0
1068	RAMOS	And you said, I don't know.	0
1069	RAMOS	Do you have an answer now?	0
1070	O'ROURKE	I do.	0
1071	O'ROURKE	And if you read the rest of that article in The Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry/exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada.	0
1072	O'ROURKE	I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa over-stays.	0
1073	O'ROURKE	But I think the larger question that we're trying to get at is, how do we rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image?	0
1074	O'ROURKE	In the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America.	0
1075	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1076	O'ROURKE	In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America.	0

1078	SYSTEM	(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
1079	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1080	O'ROURKE	I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way.	0
1081	O'ROURKE	Never cage another child.	0
1082	O'ROURKE	Make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody, but also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job.	0
1083	O'ROURKE	That we have been part of deporting people, hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone, who posed no threat to this country, breaking up their families.	0
1084	O'ROURKE	Democrats have to get off the back foot, we have to lead on this issue, because we know it is right.	0
1085	O'ROURKE	Legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million DREAMers, make them U.S. citizens right now in this, their true home country...	0
1086	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0

1097	STEPHANOPOULOS	The U.S. relationship with China, trade, and President Trump's tariffs.	0
1098	STEPHANOPOULOS	We received more than 100 questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs.	0
1099	STEPHANOPOULOS	And, Mr. Yang, let me begin with you.	0
1100	STEPHANOPOULOS	Would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office?	0
1101	STEPHANOPOULOS	And if so, would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with China?	0
1102	YANG	I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal, because right now, the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.	0
1103	YANG	A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head.	0

1105	YANG	And, two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.	0
1106	YANG	So, the imbalances are real.	0
1107	YANG	But we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides.	0
1108	YANG	So, no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.	0
1109	STEPHANOPOULOS	Mayor Pete, let me take that question -- let me take that question to you, because you've seen President Trump's tweets.	0
1110	STEPHANOPOULOS	He says what's going to happen here is the Chinese are just going to wait him out so that they can get a Democrat who they can take advantage of.	0
1111	STEPHANOPOULOS	How do you think about China?	0
1112	STEPHANOPOULOS	We've seen President Trump call President Xi both an enemy and a friend.	0
1113	BUTTIGIEG	Well, the president clearly has no strategy.	0
1114	BUTTIGIEG	You know, when I first got into this race, I remember President Trump scoffed and said he'd like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping.	0
1115	BUTTIGIEG	I'd like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.	0
1116	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1117	BUTTIGIEG	Is it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April?	0
1118	BUTTIGIEG	It's one more example of a commitment not made.	0
1119	BUTTIGIEG	When that happens on the international stage, people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans.	0
1120	BUTTIGIEG	And when that happens, there are serious consequences.	0
1121	BUTTIGIEG	We saw it at the G7.	0
1122	BUTTIGIEG	The leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been.	0
1123	BUTTIGIEG	The problem is, this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever, whether it's in Hong Kong, where those protesters for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States, or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around.	0
1124	BUTTIGIEG	The world needs America, but it can't be just any America.	0
1125	STEPHANOPOULOS	Would you repeal the tariffs?	0
1126	BUTTIGIEG	I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but it's not about the tariffs.	0
1127	BUTTIGIEG	Look, what's going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and there's a lack of a bigger strategy.	0
1128	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Klobuchar, you've actually supported the tariffs on steel.	0
1129	KLOBUCHAR	What we've got right now, though, George, it's not a focused tariff on steel.	0
1130	KLOBUCHAR	What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies.	0
1131	KLOBUCHAR	He has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.	0
1132	KLOBUCHAR	And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country.	0
1133	KLOBUCHAR	One forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300,000 jobs, all right?	0
1134	KLOBUCHAR	There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest, in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa.	0
1135	KLOBUCHAR	So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table -- that's what I would do.	0
1136	KLOBUCHAR	I wouldn't have put all these tariffs in place.	0
1137	KLOBUCHAR	And I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces he's going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13th, he cuts it in half, a week later, he says he's going to reduce taxes, the day after that, he says he's going to do it.	0
1138	KLOBUCHAR	The leaders of the world are watching this, and it undermines our strength as a nation.	0
1139	KLOBUCHAR	And, yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world.	0
1140	KLOBUCHAR	And he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement, like we've done in northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that, so that our workers can benefit, so we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it's a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things, and exporting to the world.	0
1141	KLOBUCHAR	He is defeating that goal.	0
1142	STEPHANOPOULOS	Secretary Castro, you actually, in one of the previous debates, identified China as the most serious national security threat to our country.	0
1143	STEPHANOPOULOS	I want to pick up on what Senator Klobuchar was saying.	0
1144	STEPHANOPOULOS	She said she would go back to the negotiating table.	0
1145	STEPHANOPOULOS	The question is, what do you do for leverage?	0
1146	STEPHANOPOULOS	Where do you get it?	0
1147	CASTRO	Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families.	0
1148	CASTRO	As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs.	0
1149	CASTRO	It's estimated that it's cost $600 to the average American family.	0
1150	CASTRO	Just a couple of days ago, 60 percent of Americans said that they believe that we're in for a recession next year.	0
1151	CASTRO	So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war.	0
1152	CASTRO	We have leverage there.	0
1153	CASTRO	I also believe, though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights.	0
1154	CASTRO	We have millions of Uighurs, for instance, in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated.	0
1155	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1156	CASTRO	And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator.	0
1157	CASTRO	We need to stop that.	0
1158	CASTRO	We need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights.	0
1159	CASTRO	When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down.	0
1160	CASTRO	We have leverage in that discussion.	0
1161	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Warren, let me bring you in on this conversation.	0
1162	STEPHANOPOULOS	President Obama signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
1163	STEPHANOPOULOS	In part, it was designed to rein in China, to bring China into some kind of regulation.	0
1164	STEPHANOPOULOS	What do you think he got wrong?	0
1165	WARREN	So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades, and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else.	0
1166	WARREN	These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they'll do it in a heartbeat.	0
1167	WARREN	And yet for decades now, who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators?	0
1168	WARREN	Who has shaped our trade policy?	0
1169	WARREN	It's been the giant corporations.	0
1170	WARREN	It's been their lobbyists and their executives.	0
1171	WARREN	The way we change our trade policy in America is, first, the procedures.	0
1172	WARREN	Who sits at the table?	0
1173	WARREN	I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table.	0
1174	WARREN	I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table.	0
1175	WARREN	I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table.	0
1176	WARREN	I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table.	0
1177	WARREN	And you asked the question about leverage.	0
1178	WARREN	If I can just respond to that one, the leverage, are you kidding?	0
1179	WARREN	Everybody wants access to the American market.	0
1180	WARREN	That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, you want to come sell goods to American consumers?	0
1181	WARREN	Then you got to raise your standards.	0
1182	WARREN	You've got to raise your labor standards.	0
1183	WARREN	You've got to raise your environmental standards...	0
1184	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1185	WARREN	... so our companies can compete on a level playing field.	0
1186	WARREN	We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country.	0
1187	WARREN	We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.	0
1188	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1189	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Harris, how would your trade policy differ from President Obama's?	0
1190	HARRIS	Well, first of all, I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy.	0
1191	HARRIS	He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego.	0
1192	HARRIS	It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy.	0
1193	HARRIS	When we look at this issue, my trade policy, under a Harris administration, is always going to be about saying, we need to export American products, not American jobs.	0
1194	HARRIS	And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.	0
1195	HARRIS	I am not a protectionist Democrat.	0
1196	HARRIS	Look, we need to sell our stuff.	0
1197	HARRIS	And that means we need to sell it to people overseas.	0
1198	HARRIS	That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.	0
1199	HARRIS	You asked earlier about China.	0
1200	HARRIS	It's a complicated relationship.	0
1201	HARRIS	We have to hold China accountable.	0
1202	HARRIS	They steal our products, including our intellectual property.	0
1203	HARRIS	They dump substandard products into our economy.	0
1204	HARRIS	They need to be held accountable.	0
1205	HARRIS	We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents.	0
1206	HARRIS	We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea.	0
1207	HARRIS	I am on -- and I think the only person on this stage -- the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee.	0
1208	HARRIS	We need a partner on the issue of North Korea.	0
1209	HARRIS	But the bottom line is this.	0
1210	HARRIS	Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in "The Wizard of Oz," you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?	0
1211	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1212	STEPHANOPOULOS	OK.	0
1213	STEPHANOPOULOS	I'm not even going to take the bait, Senator Harris.	0
1214	STEPHANOPOULOS	But I am going to take...	0
1215	HARRIS	Oh, George, it wasn't about you.	0
1216	STEPHANOPOULOS	I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders right now.	0
1217	SANDERS	Well, there is a reason -- there is a reason why, in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago.	0
1218	SANDERS	And one of the reasons is that, for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies.	0
1219	SANDERS	I got to say to my good friend, Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade.	0
1220	SANDERS	I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs.	0
1221	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1222	SANDERS	And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50 percent of what they made in manufacturing.	0
1223	SANDERS	So Trump, obviously, hasn't a clue.	0
1224	SANDERS	Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
1225	SANDERS	What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere, who are losing billions right now because of Trump's policy, a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad, and then thinks they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.	0
1226	STEPHANOPOULOS	Vice President Biden, he invoked your name.	0
1227	BIDEN	Yeah, well, look, we're either going to make policy or China's going to make the rules of the road.	0
1228	BIDEN	We make up 25 percent of the world economy.	0
1229	BIDEN	We need another 25 percent to join us.	0
1230	BIDEN	And I think Elizabeth -- Senator Warren is correct.	0
1231	BIDEN	At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists.	0
1232	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is, China -- the problem isn't the trade deficit, the problem is they're stealing our intellectual property.	0
1233	BIDEN	The problem is they're violating the WTO.	0
1234	BIDEN	They're dumping steel on us.	0
1235	BIDEN	That's a different issue than whether or not they're dumping agricultural products on us.	0
1236	BIDEN	In addition to that, we're in a position where, if we don't set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules.	0
1237	BIDEN	And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China, to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.	0
1238	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Booker, close out this round.	0
1239	BOOKER	Sure.	0
1240	BOOKER	There's one point we're really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump's America first policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy.	0
1241	BIDEN	Exactly right.	0
1242	BOOKER	From trade to battling China to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris climate accords.	0
1243	BOOKER	And on trade, he's deciding to take on China, while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies.	0
1244	BOOKER	You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada.	0
1245	BOOKER	Now, look, I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat.	0
1246	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1247	BOOKER	We cannot go up against China alone.	0
1248	BOOKER	This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators, like Duterte and Putin, than he does with Merkel and Macron.	0
1249	BOOKER	We are the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose.	0
1250	BOOKER	That's how we beat China.	0
1251	BOOKER	That's how we beat climate change on the planet Earth, and that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers' rights.	0
1252	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1253	STEPHANOPOULOS	David?	0
1254	MUIR	George, thank you.	0
1255	MUIR	I want to turn now to our troops overseas and to America's longest war in Afghanistan.	0
1256	MUIR	U.S. talks with the Taliban are dead, according to the president.	0
1257	MUIR	Secret talks at Camp David have been canceled before they could happen.	0
1258	MUIR	Many of you have weighed in on that already, so I want to move past that tonight to what all of you have promised on the campaign trail.	0
1259	MUIR	Many of you on this stage have said you'd bring the troops home in your first term.	0
1260	MUIR	Others have said in your first year.	0
1261	MUIR	Senator Warren, we all know the presidency is much different from the campaign trail.	0
1262	MUIR	President Obama wanted to bring the troops home.	0
1263	MUIR	President Trump promised to bring the troops home.	0
1264	MUIR	And you have said of Afghanistan, let's help them reach a peace settlement.	0
1265	MUIR	It is time to bring our troops home, in your words, starting right now.	0
1266	MUIR	Would you keep that promise to bring the troops home starting right now with no deal with the Taliban?	0
1267	WARREN	Yes.	0
1268	WARREN	And I'll tell you why.	0
1269	WARREN	What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States.	0
1270	WARREN	It is not helping the safety and security of the world.	0
1271	WARREN	It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan.	0
1272	WARREN	We need to bring our troops home.	0
1273	WARREN	And then we need to make a big shift.	0
1274	WARREN	We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.	0
1275	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1276	WARREN	We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan.	0
1277	WARREN	We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America.	0
1278	WARREN	We need to work together to root out terrorism.	0
1279	WARREN	It means using all of our tools.	0
1280	WARREN	It means economic investment.	0
1281	WARREN	It means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries.	0
1282	WARREN	We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values.	0
1283	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Warren, a quick follow on that, because top U.S. leaders, military leaders on the ground in Afghanistan told me you can't do it without a deal with the Taliban.	0
1284	STEPHANOPOULOS	You just said you would, you would bring them home.	0
1285	STEPHANOPOULOS	What if they told you that?	0
1286	STEPHANOPOULOS	Would you listen to their advice?	0
1287	WARREN	I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer.	0
1288	WARREN	I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick.	0
1289	WARREN	And I talked to people -- we did -- we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders, we talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: Show me what winning looks like.	0
1290	WARREN	Tell me what it looks like.	0
1291	WARREN	And what you hear is a lot of, "Uh," because no one can describe it.	0
1292	WARREN	And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.	0
1293	WARREN	I have three older brothers who all served in the military.	0
1294	WARREN	I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made.	0
1295	WARREN	They will do anything we ask them to do.	0
1296	WARREN	But we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve.	0
1297	WARREN	We need to work with the rest of the world.	0
1298	WARREN	We need to use our economic tools.	0
1299	WARREN	We need to use our diplomatic tools.	0
1300	WARREN	We need to build with our allies.	0
1301	WARREN	And we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.	0
1302	MUIR	Senator Warren, thank you.	0
1303	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1304	MUIR	I do want to stay on this, and I want to turn to Mayor Buttigieg, because you're the only veteran on this stage.	0
1305	MUIR	You served in Afghanistan.	0
1306	MUIR	We heard in recent days from General Joseph Dunford, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in recent days, "I'm not going to use the word withdrawal right now.	0
1307	MUIR	It's our judgment the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence."	0
1308	MUIR	If he's not even using the word withdrawal, would you put your promise to bring troops home in the first year on hold to follow the advice?	0
1309	BUTTIGIEG	You know, I served under General Dunford, way under General Dunford, in Afghanistan.	0
1310	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1311	BUTTIGIEG	And today, September 12, 2019, means that today you could be 18 years old, old enough to serve, and had not been alive on 9/11.	0
1312	BUTTIGIEG	We have got to put an end to endless war.	0
1313	BUTTIGIEG	And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland, and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops.	0
1314	BUTTIGIEG	Let me say something else, because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.	0
1315	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1316	BUTTIGIEG	And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset.	0
1317	BUTTIGIEG	Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization.	0
1318	BUTTIGIEG	Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there.	0
1319	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1320	BUTTIGIEG	By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment.	0
1321	BUTTIGIEG	We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels?	0
1322	BUTTIGIEG	I'll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform, is do not let these men and women down.	0
1323	BUTTIGIEG	This president is doing exactly that.	0
1324	BUTTIGIEG	I will not.	0
1325	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1326	MUIR	Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.	0
1327	MUIR	I want to turn to Vice President Biden, because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan, if you pulled the U.S. troops out, has been heightened by what we've seen in recent days on the ground in Iraq.	0
1328	MUIR	When you were vice president, President Obama turned to you to bring the troops home from Iraq.	0
1329	MUIR	You have said on the campaign trail, quote, "I made sure the president turned to me and said, Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq."	0
1330	MUIR	There was a major drawdown of U.S. troops, and then ISIS seized by some estimates 40 percent of the territory in Iraq.	0
1331	MUIR	You then had to send thousands of troops back in.	0
1332	MUIR	Was it wrong to pull out of Iraq that quickly?	0
1333	MUIR	And did the move actually help ISIS take hold?	0
1334	BIDEN	No, it wasn't wrong to pull out.	0
1335	BIDEN	But I want to answer your Afghanistan question.	0
1336	BIDEN	I've been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service.	0
1337	BIDEN	But I've been out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this -- and it's an open secret, you reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan.	0
1338	BIDEN	The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency, meaning that we're going to put that country together.	0
1339	BIDEN	It cannot be put together.	0
1340	BIDEN	Let me say it again.	0
1341	BIDEN	It will not be put together.	0
1342	BIDEN	It's three different countries.	0
1343	BIDEN	Pakistan owns the three counties -- the three provinces in the east.	0
1344	BIDEN	They're not any part of -- the Haqqanis run it.	0
1345	BIDEN	I will go on and on.	0
1346	BIDEN	But here's the point.	0
1347	BIDEN	The point is that it's a counterterrorism strategy.	0
1348	BIDEN	We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases -- insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to air lift from and to move against what we know.	0
1349	BIDEN	We don't need those troops there.	0
1350	BIDEN	I would bring them home.	0
1351	BIDEN	And Joe Dunford's a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.	0
1352	BIDEN	With regard to -- with regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that, you know, I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do.	0
1353	BIDEN	The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the Security Council to vote 15-0 to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons.	0
1354	BIDEN	And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof.	0
1355	BIDEN	I said something that was not meant the way I said it.	0
1356	BIDEN	I said -- from that point on -- what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way; there was no plan; we should not be engaged; we didn't have the people with us; we didn't have our -- we didn't have allies with us, et cetera.	0
1357	BIDEN	And it was later, when we came into office, that Barack turned -- the president turned to me and said, "Joe" -- when they said we've got a plan to get out, he turned to the whole security and said, "Joe will organize this.	0
1358	BIDEN	Get the troops home."	0
1359	BIDEN	My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand.	0
1360	BIDEN	It made -- and we were right to get the combat troops out.	0
1361	BIDEN	The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming -- from moving in.	0
1362	MUIR	Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
1363	MUIR	I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this.	0
1364	MUIR	Because the concern over Afghanistan is very similar to what we saw in Iraq when the troops came out.	0
1365	MUIR	ISIS filled that vacuum.	0
1366	MUIR	What do you make of people out there who are worried that if we pull out U.S. troops too quickly from Afghanistan, it will create safe haven all over again, like the plotters of 9/11?	0
1367	SANDERS	David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said.	0
1368	SANDERS	You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge.	0
1369	SANDERS	The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq...	0
1370	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1371	BIDEN	You're right.	0
1372	SANDERS	I voted against the war in Iraq	0
1373	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1374	SANDERS	... and helped lead the opposition.	0
1375	SANDERS	And it's sad to say -- I mean, I, kind of, you know, had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war.	0
1376	SANDERS	As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said.	0
1377	SANDERS	We cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend them -- defend us, who have responded to the call of duty.	0
1378	SANDERS	But I think, also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump's military budgets.	0
1379	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1380	SANDERS	I don't think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don't even know who our enemy is.	0
1381	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1382	SANDERS	I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together -- bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism.	0
1383	SANDERS	And make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism.	0
1384	SANDERS	But dropping bomb on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.	0
1385	MUIR	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
1386	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1387	MUIR	I want to take this to Mr. Yang.	0
1388	MUIR	You share the stage, as you know, when when we talk about troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the vice president, who was in the Situation Room, with senators who were on the Senate Armed Services, the Foreign Relations Committees, with an Afghanistan veteran who is on the stage tonight.	0
1389	MUIR	As you share the stage with these candidates, what makes you the most qualified on this stage to be commander in chief?	0
1390	YANG	I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars.	0
1391	YANG	We've been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years, which is not what the American people want.	0
1392	YANG	We have to start owning what we can and can't do.	0
1393	YANG	We're not very good at rebuilding countries.	0
1394	YANG	And if you want proof, all you have to do is look within our own country of Puerto Rico.	0
1395	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1396	YANG	We've spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives -- and thank you, Pete, for your service.	0
1397	YANG	And the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades.	0
1398	YANG	I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment.	0
1399	YANG	What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way.	0
1400	YANG	And that's what I would do as president.	0
1401	MUIR	Mr. Yang, thank you.	0
1402	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1403	MUIR	Jorge?	0
1404	RAMOS	Thank you very much.	0
1405	SYSTEM	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (ph)	0
1406	RAMOS	You haven't been asked about Latin America in the previous debates, so let's begin.	0
1407	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, one country where many immigrants are arriving from is Venezuela.	0
1408	RAMOS	A recent U.N. fact-finding mission found that thousands have been disappeared, tortured and killed by government forces in Venezuela.	0
1409	RAMOS	You admit that Venezuela does not have free elections, but still you refuse to call Nicolas Maduro a dictator -- a dictator.	0
1410	RAMOS	Can you explain why?	0
1411	RAMOS	And what are the main differences between your kind of socialism and the one being imposed in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua?	0
1412	SANDERS	Well, first of all, let me be very clear.	0
1413	SANDERS	Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant.	0
1414	SANDERS	What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make -- can create their own future.	0
1415	SANDERS	In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair.	0
1416	SANDERS	I'll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism.	0
1417	SANDERS	I agree with goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right.	0
1418	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1419	SANDERS	I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.	0
1420	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1421	SANDERS	I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement.	0
1422	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1423	SANDERS	I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge -- it's not in the media and not in Congress.	0
1424	SANDERS	You've got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country.	0
1425	SANDERS	You've got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies and in the media.	0
1426	SANDERS	Maybe, just maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy...	0
1427	RAMOS	Thank you.	0
1428	SANDERS	... that works for all of us, not 1 percent.	0
1429	SANDERS	That's my understanding of democratic socialism.	0
1430	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1431	RAMOS	Secretary, you wanted to say a quick response -- 45 seconds?	0
1432	CASTRO	Sure, thank you, Jorge.	0
1433	CASTRO	I'll call Maduro a dictator, because he is a dictator.	0
1434	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1435	CASTRO	And what we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they'll have free and fair elections, and also, here in the United States, offer temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans.	0
1436	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1437	CASTRO	That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do.	0
1438	CASTRO	For all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community, he has failed.	0
1439	CASTRO	I will not.	0
1440	CASTRO	I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st century Marshall plan for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala...	0
1441	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1442	CASTRO	... so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States.	0
1443	CASTRO	And under my administration, we're going to put renewed focus on Latin America.	0
1444	CASTRO	It makes sense.	0
1445	CASTRO	They're our neighbors and we have a lot of things in common.	0
1446	CASTRO	It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately.	0
1447	RAMOS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1448	CASTRO	And I will	0
1449	RAMOS	Senator Booker, let me ask you about Brazil.	0
1450	RAMOS	After the recent fires in the Amazon, some experts suggested that eating less meat is one way to help the environment.	0
1451	RAMOS	You are a vegan since 2014.	0
1452	RAMOS	That's obviously a personal choice, but President Trump and Brazil's President Bolsonaro are concerned that climate change regulations could affect economic growth.	0
1453	RAMOS	So should more Americans, including those here in Texas, and in Iowa...	0
1454	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1455	RAMOS	... follow your diet?	0
1456	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1457	BOOKER	Um (ph), you know, first of all, I want to say no.	0
1458	BOOKER	Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish.	0
1459	BOOKER	No.	0
1460	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1461	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1462	BOOKER	Look, on -- let's just be clear.	0
1463	BOOKER	The factory farming going on that's assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agricultural industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment.	0
1464	BOOKER	And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don't line up with our values.	0
1465	BOOKER	That's what I'm calling for.	0
1466	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1467	BOOKER	But I want to -- I want to switch, because we don't have -- a crowded debate stage, we were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq.	0
1468	BOOKER	It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country.	0
1469	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1470	BOOKER	We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts and harms.	0
1471	BOOKER	They're disproportionately homeless.	0
1472	BOOKER	You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA.	0
1473	BOOKER	It is very important that, as we -- as a country, understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism, that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us.	0
1474	BOOKER	We end our national anthem with "home of the brave."	0
1475	BOOKER	It's about time we make this a better home for our bravest.	0

1477	RAMOS	Congressman O'Rourke, Hurricane Harvey hit this town two years ago.	0
1478	RAMOS	And not only is the Amazon burning, Greenland is melting at a record pace.	0
1479	RAMOS	The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded.	0
1480	RAMOS	And we have a viewer's question about this.	0
1481	RAMOS	What meaningful action will you take to reverse the effect of climate change?	0
1482	RAMOS	And can we count on you to follow through if your donors are against it?	0
1483	O'ROURKE	Yes, we will follow through, regardless of the political consequences or who it offends, because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it.	0
1484	O'ROURKE	We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050.	0
1485	O'ROURKE	That we are halfway there by 2030.	0
1486	O'ROURKE	That we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that.	0
1487	O'ROURKE	That we invest here in Houston, Texas, with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding given the fact that this town has seen three 500-year floods in just five years, you'd like to think you're good for 1,500 years, but you're not.	0
1488	O'ROURKE	They're coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever.	0
1489	O'ROURKE	We're also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that.	0
1490	O'ROURKE	And that we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services they want to provide.	0
1491	O'ROURKE	Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil.	0
1492	O'ROURKE	That's the way that we're going to meet this challenge and we're going to bring everyone into the solution.	0
1493	RAMOS	Many of you want to comment.	0
1494	RAMOS	Let's see if we can go very fast.	0
1495	RAMOS	Senator Klobuchar?	0
1496	KLOBUCHAR	Thank you.	0
1497	KLOBUCHAR	This is the existential crisis of our time.	0
1498	KLOBUCHAR	It's -- you know that movie "The Day after Tomorrow"?	0
1499	KLOBUCHAR	It's today.	0
1500	KLOBUCHAR	We have seen a warming in our world like never before.	0
1501	KLOBUCHAR	We're seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston, fires in the West.	0
1502	KLOBUCHAR	And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done.	0
1503	KLOBUCHAR	On day one, I will get us back into the international climate change agreement.	0
1504	KLOBUCHAR	On day two, I will bring back the clean power rules that President Obama had worked on.	0
1505	KLOBUCHAR	On day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards.	0
1506	KLOBUCHAR	You can do all that without Congress, which is good.	0
1507	KLOBUCHAR	On day four, five, and six I will, working with Congress and mayors and business people all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal.	0
1508	KLOBUCHAR	And on day seven, you're supposed to rest, but I won't.	0
1509	KLOBUCHAR	This is what we need to do if we're going to get at climate change.	0
1510	KLOBUCHAR	We have to take this on as a crisis that's happening right now.	0
1511	RAMOS	Senator Warren, should American foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change?	0
1512	WARREN	Yes.	0
1513	WARREN	We need to work on every front on climate change.	0
1514	WARREN	It is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time.	0
1515	WARREN	Every time the scientists go back, they say, we have less and less time than we thought we had.	0
1516	WARREN	But that means we've got to use all the tools.	0
1517	WARREN	One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools.	0
1518	WARREN	I have proposed following Governor Inslee, that we, by 2028, cut all carbon emissions from new buildings.	0
1519	WARREN	By 2030, carbon emissions from cars.	0
1520	WARREN	And by 2035, all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity.	0
1521	WARREN	That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70 percent.	0
1522	WARREN	We can do this.	0
1523	WARREN	We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time.	0
1524	WARREN	Why doesn't it happen?	0
1525	WARREN	As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can't make the changes we need to make.	0
1526	WARREN	We have to attack the corruption head-on so that we can save our planet.	0

1528	RAMOS	Senator Harris, 45 seconds.	0
1529	HARRIS	When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one-and-a-half and three years old.	0
1530	HARRIS	When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared.	0
1531	HARRIS	And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two-and-a-half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children and then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage.	0
1532	HARRIS	And this is an issue that, yes, it represents a existential threat.	0
1533	HARRIS	It is also something that we can do something about.	0
1534	HARRIS	This is a problem that was created by human behaviors.	0
1535	HARRIS	And we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet.	0
1536	HARRIS	I've seen it happen in California.	0
1537	HARRIS	I took on -- as the attorney general of California, I ran the second-largest department of justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice.	0
1538	HARRIS	I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress.	0
1539	HARRIS	If any of you have been to Los Angeles, 20 years ago, you'll remember, that sky was brown.	0
1540	HARRIS	You go there now, the sky is blue and you know why?	0
1541	HARRIS	Because leaders decided to lead and we took on these big fossil fuel companies.	0
1542	HARRIS	We have some of the most important and strongest laws in the country and we made a difference.	0
1543	HARRIS	And my point being, I've done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time, the clock is ticking, but we need courage, and we need courageous leadership.	0
1544	HARRIS	We can get this done.	0
1545	RAMOS	Mr. Yang?	0
1546	YANG	So, to follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies?	0
1547	WARREN	Yes.	0
1548	YANG	Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA?	0
1549	YANG	And is answer is this, we all know, everyone on this stage knows that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests.	0
1550	YANG	Now, everyone here has a plan to try to curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts.	0
1551	YANG	Money finds a way.	0
1552	YANG	Money will find its way back in.	0
1553	YANG	So, what is the answer?	0
1554	YANG	The answer is to wash the money out with people-powered money.	0
1555	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1556	YANG	My proposal is that we give every American 100 "Democracy Dollars" that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like.	0
1557	YANG	This would wash out the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one.	0
1558	YANG	That is the only way we will win.	0
1559	YANG	And as someone running for president, I'll tell you, there's the people on one side and the money on the other, the only way for us to win is if we bring them together.	0

1563	DAVIS	I'd like to have an academic discussion now about education.	0
1564	DAVIS	Mr. Yang, we'll stay with you.	0
1565	DAVIS	Here in Houston, the school district is facing yet another year of spending cuts.	0
1566	DAVIS	Like schools across the country, the system faces many challenges.	0
1567	DAVIS	One of them, thousands of students are leaving traditional public schools and going to charter schools.	0
1568	DAVIS	You're the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools.	0
1569	DAVIS	You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, "just jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice."	0
1570	DAVIS	Why isn't taxpayer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools?	0
1571	YANG	Let me be clear, I am pro-good school.	0
1572	YANG	I've got a kid, one of my little boys just started public school last week and I was not there because I was running for president.	0
1573	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1574	YANG	So, we need to pay teachers more, because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.	0
1575	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1576	YANG	We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth.	0
1577	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1578	YANG	But here's the big one.	0
1579	YANG	The data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students outcomes are determined outside of the school.	0
1580	YANG	We're talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they're young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood.	0
1581	YANG	We're putting money into schools, and educators know this, we're saying you're 100 percent responsible for educating your kids but you can only control 30 percent.	0
1582	YANG	They all know this.	0
1583	YANG	The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach.	0
1584	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1585	DAVIS	Mayor Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond.	0
1586	BUTTIGIEG	Step one is appoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education.	0
1587	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1588	BUTTIGIEG	I believe in public education.	0
1589	BUTTIGIEG	And in order to strengthen it, some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we have got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning.	0
1590	BUTTIGIEG	Some of it is extremely simple, we have just got to pay teachers more.	0
1591	BUTTIGIEG	And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.	0
1592	BUTTIGIEG	I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan.	0
1593	BUTTIGIEG	They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher.	0
1594	BUTTIGIEG	And they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college.	0
1595	BUTTIGIEG	She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well.	0
1596	BUTTIGIEG	And she came up just short.	0
1597	BUTTIGIEG	So, you know what she did?	0
1598	BUTTIGIEG	Since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fall-back plan, she became a doctor.	0
1599	BUTTIGIEG	That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession.	0
1600	BUTTIGIEG	If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession.	0
1601	BUTTIGIEG	Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.	0
1602	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1603	DAVIS	Senator Warren, to use Mr. Yang's term, are you just jumping into bed with teachers unions?	0
1604	WARREN	You know, I think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher.	0
1605	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1606	WARREN	I had wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade.	0
1607	WARREN	And let's be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.	0
1608	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0

1610	WARREN	I will -- we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher.	0

1612	WARREN	I think this is ultimately about our values.	0
1613	WARREN	I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country.	0
1614	WARREN	That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to five, universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country...	0
1615	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1616	WARREN	... raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who've got it...	0
1617	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1618	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1619	WARREN	... and strengthen our unions.	0
1620	WARREN	This is how we build an America that reflects our values, not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives.	0
1621	DAVIS	Senator Harris, 45 seconds to respond.	0
1622	HARRIS	My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson (ph), God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation.	0
1623	HARRIS	I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us.	0
1624	HARRIS	I have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this, which will be the first in the nation, federal investment, in closing the teacher pay gap, which is $13,500 a year.	0
1625	HARRIS	Because right now, in our public schools, our teachers, 94 percent of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies.	0
1626	HARRIS	And that is wrong.	0
1627	HARRIS	I also want to talk about where we are here at TSU, and what it means in terms of HBCUs.	0

1630	HARRIS	Because -- because, one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university, I will say -- I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these may professions, but also...	0
1631	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1632	HARRIS	But this is a critical point, if a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade, they're 13 percent more likely to go to college.	0
1633	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1634	HARRIS	If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade, they're 32 percent more likely to go to college.	0
1635	HARRIS	So, when we talk about investing in our public education system, it is at the source of so much.	0
1636	HARRIS	When we fix it, that will fix so many other things.	0
1637	HARRIS	We must invest in the potential of our children...	0
1638	DAVIS	Thank yo, Senator.	0
1639	DAVIS	Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.	0
1640	HARRIS	... and I strongly believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children.	0
1641	HARRIS	And we are failing on this issue.	0
1642	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1643	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1644	SANDERS	Guess what?	0
1645	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1646	SANDERS	You're guessing, all right, here's the answer.	0
1647	SANDERS	We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world.	0
1648	SANDERS	And yet, we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on earth.	0
1649	SANDERS	We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can't work two or three jobs to support themselves.	0
1650	SANDERS	Which is why, under my legislation, we'll move to see that every teacher in America makings at least $60,000 a year.	0
1651	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1652	SANDERS	What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges and universities and HBCUs debt-free.	0
1653	SANDERS	And what we will always also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.	0
1654	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1655	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1656	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1657	SANDERS	And we are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
1658	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1659	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1660	DAVIS	Mr. Vice president, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race.	0
1661	DAVIS	In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, "I don't feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I'll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago."	0
1662	DAVIS	You said that some 40 years ago.	0
1663	DAVIS	But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?	0
1664	BIDEN	Well, they have to deal with the -- look, there's institutional segregation in this country.	0
1665	BIDEN	And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that.	0
1666	BIDEN	Red-lining banks, making sure that we are in a position where -- look, you talk about education.	0
1667	BIDEN	I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to $45 billion a year.	0
1668	BIDEN	Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out -- the $60,000 level.	0
1669	BIDEN	Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home.	0
1670	BIDEN	The problems that come from home, we need -- we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today.	0
1671	BIDEN	It's crazy.	0
1672	BIDEN	The teachers are -- I'm married to a teacher.	0
1673	BIDEN	My deceased wife is a teacher.	0
1674	BIDEN	They have every problem coming to them.	0
1675	BIDEN	We have -- make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds go to school.	0
1676	BIDEN	School.	0
1677	BIDEN	Not daycare.	0
1678	BIDEN	School.	0
1679	BIDEN	We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.	0
1680	BIDEN	It's not want they don't want to help.	0
1681	BIDEN	They don't -- they don't know quite what to do.	0
1682	BIDEN	Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the -- the -- make sure that kids hear words.	0
1683	BIDEN	A kid coming from a very poor school -- a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.	0
1684	DAVIS	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
1685	BIDEN	There's so much we -- no, I'm going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, OK?	0
1686	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1687	BIDEN	Because here's the deal.	0
1688	BIDEN	The deal is that we've got this a little backwards.	0
1689	BIDEN	And by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela.	0
1690	BIDEN	I know Maduro.	0
1691	BIDEN	I've confronted Maduro.	0
1692	BIDEN	Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America.	0
1693	BIDEN	I'm the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don't have to chance to leave.	0
1694	BIDEN	You're all acting like we just discovered this yesterday.	0
1695	BIDEN	Thank you very much.	0
1696	DAVIS	Thank you very much.	0
1697	DAVIS	Secretary Castro?	0
1698	CASTRO	Thank you very much.	0
1699	CASTRO	Well, that's -- that's quite a lot.	0
1700	SYSTEM	(OFF-MIKE)	0
1701	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1702	CASTRO	But, you know -- I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about and a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation.	0
1703	CASTRO	In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools.	0
1704	CASTRO	And I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated.	0
1705	CASTRO	Now, I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED, and health care opportunities, and those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.	0
1706	CASTRO	Those are the types of things that we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools.	0
1707	CASTRO	You asked a second ago about charter schools.	0
1708	CASTRO	Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools.	0
1709	CASTRO	They're not.	0
1710	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1711	DAVIS	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1712	CASTRO	And so while I'm not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.	0
1713	DAVIS	Senator Booker, coming to you now.	0
1714	DAVIS	It was 65 years ago this year that the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools.	0
1715	DAVIS	Yet for millions of students of color today, segregation remains a reality.	0
1716	DAVIS	Nonwhite districts typically receive $2,200 less per student than those in white districts.	0
1717	DAVIS	This means older books, less access to computers, and often worse outcomes.	0
1718	DAVIS	What is your plan to address segregation?	0
1719	DAVIS	And I'm not just talking about the achievement gap, but I'm talking about the opportunity gap in education.	0
1720	BOOKER	So, I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that -- and the way we talk about communities of color.	0
1721	BOOKER	Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line.	0
1722	BOOKER	I've lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius.	0
1723	BOOKER	I think I'm the only person on the stage -- even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system -- I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results.	0
1724	BOOKER	A lot of folks here are talking about raising teacher salary.	0
1725	BOOKER	We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.	0
1726	BOOKER	And we didn't stop there.	0
1727	BOOKER	Yeah, we closed poor-performing charter schools, but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools.	0
1728	BOOKER	We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community.	0
1729	BOOKER	The results speak for themselves.	0
1730	BOOKER	We're now the number-one city in America for Beat the Odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.	0
1731	BOOKER	Strategies like investing in our children work.	0
1732	BOOKER	And I'll tell you this.	0
1733	BOOKER	I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues.	0
1734	BOOKER	That's why my friend, Secretary Castro, is 100 percent right.	0
1735	BOOKER	We are in the reality we are right now because, Mr. Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime, that were red-lining communities, disinvesting in communities, and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they're also struggling with environmental injustice.	0
1736	BOOKER	If you've talked to someone who's a parent of a child has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you'll know this is a national problem, because there's over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.	0
1737	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1738	BOOKER	And so if I'm president of the United States, it is a holistic solution to education, from raising teacher salary, fully funded special education, but combatting the issues of poverty, combatting the issues of racial segregation, combatting the issues of a criminal justice system...	0
1739	DAVIS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1740	BOOKER	... that takes parents away from their kids, and dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.	0
1741	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you, Linsey.	0
1742	STEPHANOPOULOS	One final question coming up.	0
1743	STEPHANOPOULOS	We'll be right back.	0
1744	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1745	STEPHANOPOULOS	And we are now back now for a final round of questions.	0
1746	STEPHANOPOULOS	One question for each candidate.	0
1747	STEPHANOPOULOS	We're going to go in reverse order from the opening statement.	0
1748	STEPHANOPOULOS	And, candidates, the question is on the quality of resilience.	0
1749	STEPHANOPOULOS	No president can succeed without resilience.	0
1750	STEPHANOPOULOS	Every president confronts crises, defeats, and mistakes.	0
1751	STEPHANOPOULOS	So I want to ask each of you, what's the most significant professional setback you've had to face?	0
1752	STEPHANOPOULOS	How did you recover from it?	0
1753	STEPHANOPOULOS	And what did you learn from it?	0
1754	STEPHANOPOULOS	Vice President Biden?	0
1755	BIDEN	I -- I never counted any professional setback like I have as a serious setback.	0
1756	BIDEN	There's things that are important.	0
1757	BIDEN	Things that are unimportant.	0
1758	SYSTEM	(OFF-MIKE)	0
1759	STEPHANOPOULOS	We're going to clear the protesters now.	0
1760	STEPHANOPOULOS	Just one minute.	0
1761	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Biden, we'll start the clock again.	0
1762	SYSTEM	(OFF-MIKE)	0
1763	BIDEN	I'm sorry.	0
1764	STEPHANOPOULOS	We're sorry.	0
1765	STEPHANOPOULOS	Go ahead.	0
1766	BIDEN	There's setbacks, and there's setbacks.	0
1767	BIDEN	And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose -- well, my dad had an expression.	0
1768	BIDEN	He said, Joey, it's not a question of succeeding, whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up.	0
1769	BIDEN	And he said, you never explain and never complain.	0
1770	BIDEN	And then he would go on to say that the only obligation that really matters, the most important thing, is family.	0
1771	BIDEN	And so I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family, and could be judged on based how you treatment your family and how you went from there.	0
1772	BIDEN	And I -- it took -- you know, Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark.	0
1773	BIDEN	Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured.	0
1774	BIDEN	And I just had been elected, not sworn in.	0
1775	BIDEN	And I lost my faith for a while.	0
1776	BIDEN	I came back.	0
1777	BIDEN	And then later, when my son Beau came home from Iraq and -- with a terminal disease, and a year later, year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul.	0
1778	BIDEN	But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do.	0
1779	BIDEN	And that's why I hope -- I hope he's proud of me today, because he wanted to make sure I didn't run for president, but I stayed engaged, because when you get hit badly, whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you can't live here anymore, Dad lost his job, you know, we've all been through that, in some form or another.	0
1780	BIDEN	And it just takes -- it just -- for me, the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose.	0
1781	BIDEN	And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy.	0
1782	BIDEN	And -- but there's a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another, without the help I had.	0
1783	BIDEN	There are real heroes out there.	0
1784	BIDEN	Some real heroes.	0
1785	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
1786	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Warren?	0
1787	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1788	WARREN	I mentioned earlier, I've known what I wanted to be since second grade.	0
1789	WARREN	I wanted to be a public school teacher.	0
1790	WARREN	And I invested early.	0
1791	WARREN	I used to line my dollies up and teach school.	0
1792	WARREN	I had a reputation for being tough but fair.	0
1793	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1794	WARREN	By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university.	0
1795	WARREN	And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns.	0
1796	WARREN	Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over.	0
1797	WARREN	I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston.	0
1798	WARREN	And I made it as a special needs teacher.	0
1799	WARREN	I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher.	0
1800	WARREN	I could tell you what those babies looked like.	0
1801	WARREN	I had 4- to 6-year-olds.	0
1802	WARREN	But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant.	0
1803	WARREN	And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me -- wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.	0
1804	WARREN	So, there I am, I'm at home, I got a baby, I can't have a job.	0
1805	WARREN	What am I going to do?	0
1806	WARREN	Here's resilience.	0
1807	WARREN	I said, I'll go to law school.	0
1808	WARREN	And the consequence was -- I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which was teaching.	0
1809	WARREN	But it let me get into fights.	0
1810	WARREN	It gave me new tools.	0
1811	WARREN	And the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back.	0
1812	WARREN	I know what's broken.	0
1813	WARREN	I want to be in the fight to fix it in America.	0
1814	WARREN	That's why I'm here.	0
1815	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you, Senator.	0
1816	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1817	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Sanders?	0
1818	SANDERS	Resilience, to me, means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket.	0
1819	SANDERS	Professional resilience means to me, George, running for U.S. Senate in Vermont and getting 1 percent of the vote, running for governor and getting 2 percent of the vote, finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont, with a 10-vote margin.	0
1820	SANDERS	What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex.	0
1821	SANDERS	And I feel confident that given a lifelong record of taking on powerful special interests, of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
1822	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
1823	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Harris?	0
1824	HARRIS	You know, every office I've run for, whether it be district attorney or attorney general, I was told each time, it can't be done.	0
1825	HARRIS	They said nobody like you has done it before, nobody's ready for you.	0
1826	HARRIS	When I ran for D.A., I won and became the first black woman elected D.A.	0
1827	HARRIS	in a state of 40 million people, in San Francisco.	0
1828	HARRIS	When I ran for attorney general of California, I was elected -- because I didn't listen.	0
1829	HARRIS	And I was the only black elected -- woman black elected attorney general in the state -- in the country.	0
1830	HARRIS	And each time, people would say, it's not your time, it's not your turn, it's going to be too difficult, they're not ready for you, and I didn't listen.	0
1831	HARRIS	And a part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me, including don't you let anybody ever tell you who you are.	0
1832	HARRIS	You tell them who you are.	0
1833	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1834	HARRIS	And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for president of the United States, and I look at the -- the meetings that we do and the community meetings, and I see these little girls and boys, sometimes even brought by their fathers, and they bring them to me and I talk to them during these events, and they smile and they're full of joy, and their fathers tell them, see, don't you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be.	0
1835	HARRIS	You have to believe in what can be unburdened by what has been.	0
1836	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1837	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Harris, thank you very much.	0
1838	STEPHANOPOULOS	Mayor Buttigieg?	0
1839	BUTTIGIEG	You know, as a military officer serving under "don't ask/don't tell," and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback.	0
1840	BUTTIGIEG	I came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life.	0
1841	BUTTIGIEG	And I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out.	0
1842	BUTTIGIEG	I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community.	0
1843	BUTTIGIEG	What happened was that, when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with 80 percent of the vote.	0
1844	BUTTIGIEG	And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning.	0
1845	BUTTIGIEG	And I think that's what we need in the presidency right now.	0
1846	BUTTIGIEG	We have to know what we are about.	0
1847	BUTTIGIEG	And this election is not about any of us up here.	0
1848	BUTTIGIEG	It is not about this president, even though it's hard to talk of anything else some days.	0
1849	BUTTIGIEG	It's about the people who trust us with their lives, a kid wondering if we're actually going to make their schools safe when they've learned active shooter drills before they've learned to read, a generation wondering we will actually get the job done on climate change.	0
1850	BUTTIGIEG	And if we hold to that, then it doesn't matter what happens to each of us professionally.	0
1851	BUTTIGIEG	Together, we will win a better era for our country.	0
1852	STEPHANOPOULOS	Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.	0
1853	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1854	STEPHANOPOULOS	Mr. Yang?	0
1855	YANG	I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and I left to start a business.	0
1856	YANG	And I'm going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship.	0
1857	YANG	If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you're going to do it.	0
1858	YANG	And then you don't have a choice.	0
1859	YANG	You put your heart and soul into that.	0
1860	YANG	And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini-rise and maximum fall.	0
1861	YANG	I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $100,000 in school debt.	0
1862	YANG	My parents still told people I was a lawyer.	0
1863	YANG	It was a little easier.	0
1864	YANG	So I remember lying on my floor looking up wondering, how did it come to this?	0
1865	YANG	Eventually, I picked myself back up.	0
1866	YANG	I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years and eventually had some success.	0
1867	YANG	Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you.	0
1868	YANG	And so I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Nguyen (ph), who's here in the audience tonight, who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio.	0
1869	YANG	Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me.	0
1870	YANG	But the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.	0
1871	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you.	0

1873	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1874	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Booker?	0
1875	BOOKER	So my biggest professional setback is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it.	0
1876	BOOKER	I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey, in 2002 took on the political machine and, boy, did they fight back.	0
1877	BOOKER	I had tires on my car slashed.	0
1878	BOOKER	Our campaign offices were broken into.	0
1879	BOOKER	My phones were tapped.	0
1880	BOOKER	It became a spectacle.	0
1881	BOOKER	And we lost that election.	0
1882	BOOKER	And here's a bit of advice to everybody.	0
1883	BOOKER	If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called "Street Fight."	0
1884	BOOKER	But then, unfortunately, another setback.	0
1885	BOOKER	It lost in the Oscars to a movie called "March of the Dagnab Penguins," for crying out loud.	0
1886	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1887	BOOKER	The people in my community, living in the projects, told me, don't give up on the people and the people won't give up on you.	0
1888	BOOKER	Create bigger and bolder coalitions, and you're going to win.	0
1889	BOOKER	And you know what?	0
1890	BOOKER	We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our city's history.	0
1891	BOOKER	But more than that, the lesson was there.	0
1892	BOOKER	We didn't give up.	0
1893	BOOKER	We were taking on America's toughest problems, from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system.	0
1894	BOOKER	There's more work to do, but I haven't given up on the people.	0
1895	BOOKER	I still live in that community.	0
1896	BOOKER	But this is a big lesson.	0
1897	BOOKER	My staff and my friends and my community told me, if you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor's race, but that's not what life is about.	0
1898	BOOKER	There's an old African saying that says, if you want to go fast, go alone.	0
1899	BOOKER	But if you want to go far, go together.	0
1900	BOOKER	The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power.	0
1901	BOOKER	And the test of America right now is not a referendum on Donald Trump, it's a referendum on us and who we are and who we're going to be together.	0
1902	BOOKER	We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation.	0
1903	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1904	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Booker, thank you.	0
1905	STEPHANOPOULOS	Congressman O'Rourke?	0
1906	O'ROURKE	Thank you, George.	0
1907	O'ROURKE	Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas.	0
1908	O'ROURKE	In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States, that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that.	0
1909	O'ROURKE	The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country.	0
1910	O'ROURKE	We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous.	0
1911	O'ROURKE	We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security, and to our safety.	0
1912	O'ROURKE	Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims.	0
1913	O'ROURKE	He's the head coach of the Fusion.	0
1914	O'ROURKE	This is a girls soccer team of 10- and 11-year-old girls.	0
1915	O'ROURKE	His name is Luis.	0
1916	O'ROURKE	He was shot in the legs multiple times.	0
1917	O'ROURKE	He was shot in the side multiple times.	0
1918	O'ROURKE	He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he's still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team.	0
1919	O'ROURKE	Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital.	0
1920	O'ROURKE	Those two men, Jessica and Marcella (ph), their wives, they exemplify resilience to me.	0
1921	O'ROURKE	And when we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we're defined not by our fears, but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be, in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.	0
1922	STEPHANOPOULOS	Congressman, thank you.	0
1923	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator Klobuchar?	0
1924	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1925	KLOBUCHAR	Thank you.	0
1926	KLOBUCHAR	My challenges and resilience have brought me up here.	0
1927	KLOBUCHAR	I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life.	0
1928	KLOBUCHAR	And after his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment.	0
1929	KLOBUCHAR	He chose treatment, with his faith, with his friends, with our family.	0
1930	KLOBUCHAR	And in his words, he was pursued by grace.	0
1931	KLOBUCHAR	And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right, to be pursued by grace.	0
1932	KLOBUCHAR	I then got married.	0
1933	KLOBUCHAR	My husband's out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter.	0
1934	KLOBUCHAR	When our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we're going to have this perfect, perfect birth, and she was really sick, and she couldn't swallow.	0
1935	KLOBUCHAR	And she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half.	0
1936	KLOBUCHAR	But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours.	0
1937	KLOBUCHAR	She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out.	0
1938	KLOBUCHAR	And I thought, this could never happen to any other mom again.	0
1939	KLOBUCHAR	So I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay.	0
1940	KLOBUCHAR	And when they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyists 2 to 1.	0
1941	KLOBUCHAR	And when they said, when should it take place, they all raised their hands and said now.	0
1942	KLOBUCHAR	That is what motivated me to go into public service.	0
1943	KLOBUCHAR	And when I got to that gridlock of Washington, D.C., I got to work and pass over 100 bills, and I know a lot of my friends here from the left, but remember, I am from the middle of the country.	0
1944	KLOBUCHAR	And I believe, if we're going to get things done, that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit, someone who's going to not just change the policies, but change the tone in the country, and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.	0
1945	STEPHANOPOULOS	Senator, thank you.	0
1946	STEPHANOPOULOS	Secretary Castro?	0
1947	CASTRO	And thank you, George, to Jorge, to Linsey, and to David, and to all of y'all for tuning in tonight.	0
1948	CASTRO	In many ways, I shouldn't be here on this stage.	0
1949	CASTRO	You know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her.	0
1950	CASTRO	I grew up in a single-parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools.	0
1951	CASTRO	Eventually, my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals.	0
1952	CASTRO	And when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town.	0
1953	CASTRO	I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000.	0
1954	CASTRO	A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council.	0
1955	CASTRO	And the city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year, so everybody had another job.	0
1956	CASTRO	And my job was at the law firm.	0
1957	CASTRO	Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client and the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal.	0
1958	CASTRO	The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer.	0
1959	CASTRO	I didn't think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it.	0
1960	CASTRO	But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas -- because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules -- you can't just go against the interest of a client.	0
1961	CASTRO	So I was stuck.	0
1962	CASTRO	On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing.	0
1963	CASTRO	On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment, depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out.	0
1964	CASTRO	So, one day, I walked into my law firm and I quit my job.	0
1965	CASTRO	And then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council.	0
1966	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1967	CASTRO	And, you know, it was the first test that I had, and I think back to that, because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting.	0
1968	CASTRO	I wondered, before I went in it, whether it was change who I was.	0
1969	CASTRO	And I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent, and not for big special interests.	0
1970	CASTRO	There's nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States.	0
1971	CASTRO	This president has failed that test.	0
1972	CASTRO	But I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won't.	0
1973	CASTRO	I won't serve anybody except you and your family.	0
1974	CASTRO	And together, we can create an American that's better than ever.	0
1975	CASTRO	Thank you very much.	0
1976	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
1977	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thank you to all of our candidates.	0
1978	STEPHANOPOULOS	It was a great debate.	0
1979	STEPHANOPOULOS	I think we learned a lot tonight thanks to you.	0
1980	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thanks to Texas Southern University for hosting us tonight.	0
1981	STEPHANOPOULOS	It was a great crowd, as well, tonight, thanks to you.	0
1982	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1983	STEPHANOPOULOS	Thanks to everyone at home.	0
1984	STEPHANOPOULOS	The debate is over.	0
1985	STEPHANOPOULOS	Our coverage continues with Tom Llamas.	0
1986	STEPHANOPOULOS	END	0
