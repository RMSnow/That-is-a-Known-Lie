435	Donald Trump	And probably seven of those times was to check out the hotel I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue and then I hop on the plane and I go back.	0
436	Donald Trump	So I've been there 17 times, never stayed there at night.	0
437	Donald Trump	I don't believe.	0
438	Donald Trump	And then I'm riding down in this beautiful car, picked up at the airport by Secret Service, holding the hand of our great first lady.	0
439	Donald Trump	And I look at her and I say, "Honey, guess what, I'm president of the United States!"	0
440	Donald Trump	President of the United States.	0

444	Donald Trump	I know the wonderful people and I know the scum.	0
445	Donald Trump	And America now is winning again like they haven't won before.	0
446	Donald Trump	We passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history, biggest cuts in history.	1
447	Donald Trump	More than 100 utilities have slashed rates for consumers including right here from Duke Energy and Tampa Electric.	0
448	Donald Trump	Your rates have gone down.	0
449	Donald Trump	Over $300 billion poured back into the United States in the first quarter, and we expect to be taking back because of our new tax cut and reform plan that passed bigger than anything ever in our country.	0
450	Donald Trump	We expect to be taking back from overseas over $4 trillion.	0
451	Donald Trump	That's a lot of money — could never have come back before.	0
452	Donald Trump	And if our opponent had won and the Democrats had won, they would've put more regulations on.	0
453	Donald Trump	They would've raised your taxes.	0
454	Donald Trump	They would've opened your borders, gotten rid of law enforcement.	0
455	Donald Trump	They would not have helped your military.	0
456	Donald Trump	And you know what?	0
457	Donald Trump	Our country would be going to hell.	0
458	Donald Trump	And instead of going up, the market would be half of what it was if we're lucky, because frankly the tax cuts were incredible to what we've done.	0
459	Donald Trump	But maybe even more important are the cuts in these horrible regulations that didn't allow anybody to do anything, job-killing regulations.	0
460	Donald Trump	We've gotten rid of more regulations than any president in the history of the United States.	0
461	Donald Trump	And that's done in less than two years.	0
462	Donald Trump	I withdrew the United States from the unfair one-sided very, very expensive job-killing Paris Climate Accord.	0
463	Donald Trump	We repealed the core of Obamacare.	0
464	Donald Trump	The individual mandate is gone.	0
465	Donald Trump	You know, the individual mandate.	0
466	Donald Trump	That's a beauty.	0
467	Donald Trump	Only the past administration could have come up with this.	0
468	Donald Trump	That's where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying in order to have poor health care.	0
469	Donald Trump	Other than that, it's a wonderful thing.	0
470	Donald Trump	So you pay all this money for the privilege of not having to pay and the health care is no good to start off with.	0
471	Donald Trump	And we're doing great on health care.	0
472	Donald Trump	We're allowing Americans to buy better health care for less money through association health plans, including across state lines, bidding, you're getting tremendous competition.	0
473	Donald Trump	We passed the biggest VA reform in half a century, Veteran's Choice.	0
474	Donald Trump	If our veterans can't get the care they need from the VA, they will have the right to go see a private doctor.	0
475	Donald Trump	We'll pay for the doctor.	0
476	Donald Trump	And frankly, we'll save a lot of money.	0
477	Donald Trump	We'll help a lot of vets.	0
478	Donald Trump	Everybody said they've been trying to get it for 45 years, everybody said you can't get it.	0

480	Donald Trump	Think of it.	0
481	Donald Trump	Veterans Choice, they have to stand – our great people.	0

485	Donald Trump	Do you like the job we're doing?	0
486	Donald Trump	Now, think of it, 45 years, everybody said you'll never get it passed.	0
487	Donald Trump	And I used to say before I really was well-versed on the veteran situation in health care, I used to say all the time, "Why don't they just let the folks go to a doctor?"	0
488	Donald Trump	They'd wait in line for 7 days, 9 days, 14 days, 21 days.	0
489	Donald Trump	Some of them started off with a very modest problem.	0
490	Donald Trump	They end up being terminal because they can't see a doctor.	0
491	Donald Trump	I said, "Why don't they just let them go see a local private doctor, pay the bill and take care of it?"	0
492	Donald Trump	It will be a lot less expensive.	0
493	Donald Trump	And it's turned out to be something that the veterans love.	0
494	Donald Trump	And it's passed.	0
495	Donald Trump	It's passed.	0
496	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get it passed for 38 years.	0
497	Donald Trump	The other one is 45, and that's VA accountability.	0
498	Donald Trump	If somebody treated our veterans badly, if they stole, if they was – if they were – you know this, if they were sadistic, if they were really bad to our vets, all right?	0
499	Donald Trump	Really, really bad, we couldn't do anything about it.	0
500	Donald Trump	They could steal.	0
501	Donald Trump	They could rob.	0
502	Donald Trump	They could be abusive.	0
503	Donald Trump	You couldn't say, "You're fired."	0
504	Donald Trump	Now you can say, "You're fired."	0

506	Donald Trump	That was another one they said you'll never get it done between civil service and unions.	0
507	Donald Trump	We love them both.	0
508	Donald Trump	But between civil service and unions they said, "You'll never get it done.	0
509	Donald Trump	You'll never get it approved."	0
510	Donald Trump	And by the way, we had virtually no help, very little from Democrats.	0
511	Donald Trump	Very little.	0
512	Donald Trump	Not because it's not right, but because they don't want to give Trump any victory.	0
513	Donald Trump	They'll do everything that's wrong.	0
514	Donald Trump	Look at Judge Kavanaugh.	0
515	Donald Trump	This is a great, great highly respected man.	0
516	Donald Trump	And the good news is the Republicans, I believe, are close to a hundred percent, which is what we need.	0
517	Donald Trump	But so far, the Democrats haven't given us any votes, and that's because they will do anything they can to not help the Trump agenda, even though they know it's wrong.	0

531	Donald Trump	And it's unfortunate.	0
532	Donald Trump	You know, we have almost 400 people trying to get into government, many of whom have left their jobs and the Democrats are holding them up with maximum delay.	0

581	Donald Trump	$1 billion, Sir.	0
582	Donald Trump	1 billion!	0
583	Donald Trump	I immediately called our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman — very successful man, great lawyer, one of the most successful lawyers in the country before he decided to do what he's doing.	0
584	Donald Trump	I said, "David, they want us to pay a billion dollars for the embassy.	0
585	Donald Trump	I don't want to pay a billion dollars."	0
586	Donald Trump	I said, "Study it – do you have any buildings that we own?"	0
587	Donald Trump	We own so much we don't even know what the hell we own.	0
588	Donald Trump	Find some building in a great location.	0
589	Donald Trump	Call me back.	0
590	Donald Trump	Called me back two days later.	0
591	Donald Trump	He said, "Mr. President, Sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem.	0
592	Donald Trump	It's big.	0
593	Donald Trump	It's beautiful and it's got a building on it.	0
594	Donald Trump	I can take that building and renovate it.	0
595	Donald Trump	I can do it for $140,000."	0
596	Donald Trump	I said, "David, how good is the site?"	0
597	Donald Trump	We could never buy a better site.	0
598	Donald Trump	They were willing to spend tens of millions for a site.	0
599	Donald Trump	They wanted to buy a site which was so bad.	0
600	Donald Trump	It was totally inferior to what we already had.	0
601	Donald Trump	Don't forget, we get there first, right?	0
602	Donald Trump	You know, we have good sites.	0
603	Donald Trump	And I said, "David, do me a favor, don't make it $140,000.	0
604	Donald Trump	Sounds too cheap.	0
605	Donald Trump	Make it like 400,000.	0
606	Donald Trump	That's okay too, David."	0
