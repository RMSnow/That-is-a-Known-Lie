145	SYSTEM	[Crowd Chants Drain the Swamp]	0
146	Patrick Morrisey	It's pretty good.	0
147	Patrick Morrisey	Now let me tell you a little bit.	0
148	Patrick Morrisey	I have an opponent in this race.	0
149	Patrick Morrisey	His name is Dishonest Liberal Joe Manchin.	0
150	Patrick Morrisey	And let me be clear, Liberal Joe is no supporter of this president.	0
151	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after -- right?	0
152	Patrick Morrisey	All right, hang on, hang on -- after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.	0
153	Patrick Morrisey	Yes, that's pretty bad.	0
154	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin even called Hillary warm, compassionate, engaging, tough.	0
155	Patrick Morrisey	Can you actually believe that?	0
156	Patrick Morrisey	Let – Joe's got to go.	0
157	Patrick Morrisey	Joe has to go.	0
158	Patrick Morrisey	Liberal Joe no longer has West Virginia values.	0
159	Patrick Morrisey	Let's go through the record.	0
160	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin was for Obama.	0
161	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin was for Hillary.	0
162	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin is for radical gun control, Planned Parenthood.	0
163	Patrick Morrisey	He shills for EpiPen, and he opposed the Trump tax cuts.	0
164	Patrick Morrisey	Let me be clear -- pretty bad, right?	0
165	Patrick Morrisey	Remember, this is West Virginia.	0
166	Patrick Morrisey	We benefit as much or more than anyone from the Trump tax cuts.	0
167	Patrick Morrisey	Joe Manchin no longer has West Virginia values, period.	0
168	Patrick Morrisey	When I get to the U.S. Senate, I'm going to be a strong ally of President Trump.	0
169	Patrick Morrisey	I'm going to be the conservative fighter that you can rely on.	0
170	Patrick Morrisey	We're going to stand up for coal and our energy resources and we're going to tackle this opiate epidemic more aggressively than anyone.	0

184	Donald Trump	He loves the people and he's going to be fighting for you.	0
185	Donald Trump	He doesn't sleep.	0
186	Donald Trump	He's out campaigning.	0
187	Donald Trump	I said how many days are you campaigning?	0
188	Donald Trump	Because I said the last 60 days of my campaign every single day, we'd go out every single day as many stops as you could make humanly.	0
189	Donald Trump	Humanly, he can't get tired.	0
190	Donald Trump	He's got that same thing.	0
191	Donald Trump	He's not going to get tired.	0
192	Donald Trump	He's every single day and he's got a very special spark.	0

196	Donald Trump	And you got to get him with us.	0
197	Donald Trump	You got to get him with us.	0
198	Donald Trump	He's going to bring it back home for the people of West Virginia.	0
199	Donald Trump	So this November, voters in West Virginia will face a very simple choice.	0
200	Donald Trump	A vote for Patrick Morrisey is truly a vote to make America great again.	0
201	Donald Trump	He's going to vote.	0
202	Donald Trump	And I like Joe, but Joe doesn't vote.	0
203	Donald Trump	He just doesn't vote for us.	0
204	Donald Trump	It's a vote for Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, their new leader Maxine Waters.	0
205	Donald Trump	But between Waters and Pelosi, you have two people that are in charge of Congress.	0
206	Donald Trump	They're not in favor of West Virginia.	0
207	Donald Trump	They don't know that West Virginia exists.	0
208	Donald Trump	They don't like coal.	0
209	Donald Trump	They don't like energy.	0
210	SYSTEM	[Audience calls We don't like her]	0
211	Donald Trump	And they don't like her.	0
212	Donald Trump	So when you cast your ballot for Congress in November, you aren't just voting for a candidate.	0
213	Donald Trump	You're voting for which party controls the House and which party controls the Senate, so all these Congress people.	0
214	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, we have to get there.	0
215	Donald Trump	We really have to get there.	0
216	Donald Trump	So I'm going to be going out as many days as I can and I'm allowed to.	0
217	Donald Trump	I have sort of a lid with all the Secret Service and all the fantastic people, but it sort of holds you back.	0
218	Donald Trump	Maybe sometimes I'll just make a few trips without them.	0
219	Donald Trump	We'll do them quietly.	0
220	Donald Trump	But we're going to be out a lot.	0
221	Donald Trump	We're going to a lot of different states, and I'm coming back here before the election.	0
222	Donald Trump	And it's a very close election.	0
223	Donald Trump	A lot of people don't realize there's a 6-point spread.	0
224	Donald Trump	Six points could be ended by this evening.	0
225	Donald Trump	He could be up by 12.	0
226	Donald Trump	You've seen what's been happening.	0
227	Donald Trump	We've had a good record of endorsements.	0
228	Donald Trump	In Georgia, a man who was down 10.	0
229	Donald Trump	I endorsed him a short while before the election -- good man, for governor -- and he won 70 to 30.	0
230	Donald Trump	So I guess he picked up 45 or 50 points.	0
231	Donald Trump	In Ohio recently there was -- he was up and then he went down a little bit.	0
232	Donald Trump	We went there, and he won.	0
233	Donald Trump	You know that, Balderson, good man, Congressman Balderson now, he won.	0
234	Donald Trump	We won eight out of nine special elections.	0
235	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about it.	0
236	Donald Trump	They don't talk about it.	0
237	Donald Trump	Eight out of nine special elections, and they don't want to talk about it.	0
238	Donald Trump	And my record – and look, I don't want to brag about it, but man, do I have a good record of endorsement.	0
239	Donald Trump	In Florida, we have a great candidate, his name is Ron DeSantis.	0
240	Donald Trump	And he called me and asked whether or not I could endorse him, and I said let me check it out.	0
241	Donald Trump	And he was a 3.	0
242	Donald Trump	This was a few months ago.	0
243	Donald Trump	He was a 3, and I gave him a nice shot and a nice little tweak, bing-bing, and he went from 3 to like 20-something.	0
244	Donald Trump	And then I gave him my full and total endorsement, and he's now leading by, like, 19 points.	0
245	Donald Trump	And that election is next week, leading in the primary.	0
246	Donald Trump	He's a good man.	0
247	Donald Trump	And so many others.	0
248	Donald Trump	Staten Island, the Congressman Dan Donovan, he was down before the election.	0
249	Donald Trump	We endorsed him.	0
250	Donald Trump	I think he won by 24 points.	0
251	Donald Trump	So if we can do just -- all my life, I've heard endorsements don't mean anything.	0
252	Donald Trump	They said if you get an endorsement from Ronald Reagan -- we like Ronald Reagan -- it was a wonderful thing to have but it didn't move the needle.	0
253	Donald Trump	And if you get an endorsement from a lot of people, it never really -- is that a correct statement?	0
254	Donald Trump	If you look, Cory, Shelley, if you get an endorsement, it was nice to have, but it didn't mean anything.	0
255	Donald Trump	These endorsements -- and I'm not saying it from my standpoint.	0
256	Donald Trump	They're going 20, 30, 40, 50 points.	0
257	Donald Trump	Fifty points, it's crazy.	0
258	Donald Trump	And then you watch the news, will this endorsement mean anything?	0
259	Donald Trump	Let me tell you, it's going to mean a lot.	0
260	Donald Trump	And I mean a lot.	0
261	Donald Trump	And I don't care, I just wanna, we have to get senators in.	0
262	Donald Trump	We've got really no majority.	0
263	Donald Trump	We have -- if you really look at it, probably we could say 49-49, 51-49.	0
264	Donald Trump	We have some people that aren't able to vote.	0
265	Donald Trump	We have some people that are a little unreliable.	0
266	Donald Trump	They don't exactly like what I've done to their career.	0
267	Donald Trump	They don't love what I've done, and that's OK. And I don't like what they've done either.	0
268	Donald Trump	But we need to elect five, six, or even seven more senators and I think we can do it.	0
269	Donald Trump	I think we can do it, and we have to start with Patrick Morrisey.	0
270	Donald Trump	He's going to be fantastic.	0
271	Donald Trump	If you vote for Joe Manchin or any other Democrat in November, you're voting for the party that wants to really destroy the coal industry.	0
272	Donald Trump	Patrick said it.	0
273	Donald Trump	Joe endorsed Hillary 100%, and he got along with her even better after she came out with a statement that she wants to destroy coal and coal companies.	0
274	Donald Trump	That's a bad thing.	0
275	Donald Trump	The Democrats want to turn America into one big fat sanctuary city for criminal aliens.	0
276	Donald Trump	And honestly, they're more protective of aliens -- the criminal aliens than they are of the people.	0
277	Donald Trump	They want to take away your Second Amendment.	0
278	Donald Trump	You see what's going on.	0
279	Donald Trump	I don't think you want your Second Amendment played with.	0
280	Donald Trump	They want to take over American health care and abuse our courts to rewrite our constitution.	0
281	Donald Trump	And how do you like the judges that I've been appointing?	0
282	Donald Trump	Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court?	0
283	Donald Trump	There's no worse nightmare for West Virginia this November than Chuck Schumer running the Senate and Nancy Pelosi with Maxine Waters running the House.	0
284	Donald Trump	And that is why you must vote Republican.	0
285	Donald Trump	You gotta get out of the vote.	0
286	Donald Trump	They keep talking about a blue wave.	0
287	Donald Trump	I don't see it.	0
288	Donald Trump	We have the greatest economy we've ever had.	0
289	Donald Trump	Joe Manchin always voted for Obama, and he voted to keep the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
290	Donald Trump	And I will tell you it is being chipped away.	0
291	Donald Trump	We had it beaten, but one man, I'm sure nobody knows who I'm talking about, voted no, shockingly.	0
292	Donald Trump	To -- really surprising to a lot of people because he campaigned on repeal and replace -- but we've really knocked it out, including the individual mandate.	0
293	Donald Trump	We got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune for not having to pay a fortune for really bad health care.	0
294	Donald Trump	OK, that's not too good.	0
295	Donald Trump	We got rid of it.	0
296	Donald Trump	A lot of people are very happy about that.	0
297	Donald Trump	That came along with the biggest tax cuts in our history.	0
298	Donald Trump	And Joe Manchin voted no on the tax cuts.	0
299	Donald Trump	The last time I was here, I saw signs along the highway, Joe, you voted no on tax cuts and Joe, you voted no for our president.	0
300	Donald Trump	You voted no.	0
301	Donald Trump	And he's going to vote no.	0
302	Donald Trump	I'm not knocking him, but Schumer's the boss and he may give us a vote on Justice Kavanaugh.	0
303	Donald Trump	He should.	0
304	Donald Trump	Everybody should.	0
305	Donald Trump	I mean, here's a guy -- is this Central Casting?	0
306	Donald Trump	This is what we want.	0
307	Donald Trump	This is a great, brilliant man.	0
308	Donald Trump	But Joe's just not voting with us.	0
309	Donald Trump	He's voting against your tax cuts.	0
310	Donald Trump	He voted against repeal and replace.	0
311	Donald Trump	He votes against the things that we want, and he votes against the people of West Virginia.	0
312	Donald Trump	You can't do that.	0
313	Donald Trump	Joe opposed the wall and he opposed the travel ban.	0
314	Donald Trump	And by the way, the wall right now, that wall is coming along.	1
315	Donald Trump	We're over $3 billion.	0

330	Donald Trump	Should have never happened.	0
331	Donald Trump	Illegally in our country.	0
332	Donald Trump	We've had a huge impact, but the laws are so bad.	0
333	Donald Trump	The immigration laws are such a disgrace.	0
334	Donald Trump	We're getting them changed, but we have to get more Republicans, we have to get.	0
335	Donald Trump	This election is bigger than any one race.	0
336	Donald Trump	It's about whether we want to continue the amazing progress we've made for America or whether we want to surrender that progress to the forces of extremism and obstruction.	0
337	Donald Trump	Their little phrase that they like, resist, that's all they're good at.	0
338	Donald Trump	They have no policy.	0
339	Donald Trump	They're not good politicians, but they're good at sticking together and resisting.	0
340	Donald Trump	I have almost 400 people that haven't been approved by their slow-walking.	1
341	Donald Trump	Do you know what's slow-walking?	0
342	Donald Trump	They're slow-walking them.	0
343	Donald Trump	We have almost 400 people in our administration, people that gave up their careers that have been waiting over a year to get approved and they're being slow-walked by the Democrats.	0
344	Donald Trump	It's never happened that way in the history of our country and it is a disgrace.	0
345	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.	0
346	Donald Trump	The Democrat Party is held hostage by the so-called resistance, left-wing haters and angry mobs.	0
347	Donald Trump	They're trying to tear down our institutions, disrespect our flag, demean our law enforcement, denigrate our history, and disparage our great country.	0
348	Donald Trump	And we're not going to let it happen.	0
349	Donald Trump	New York's Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo even declared that America was never great.	0
350	Donald Trump	Oh, I see, OK. Tell that to our great soldiers at World War I, World War II, Korean War, so many others.	0
351	Donald Trump	Tell them to the folks that sent a rocket up to the moon and our great astronauts.	0
352	Donald Trump	Tell them to all of the great medical research we've done in this country and he says America was never great.	0
353	Donald Trump	I would imagine that's career-threatening, right?	0
354	Donald Trump	I would imagine.	0
355	Donald Trump	How do you get away with that one?	0
356	Donald Trump	Did you hear?	0
357	Donald Trump	He was speaking to a room loaded up with socialists and probably others, probably others.	0
358	Donald Trump	No not communists, but there could have been a couple of them, too.	0
359	Donald Trump	And he made the statement that America was never great and they would go, did you hear?	0
360	Donald Trump	They go, whoa,whoa.	0
361	Donald Trump	They couldn't even believe it.	0
362	Donald Trump	Now that's job-threatening.	0
363	Donald Trump	His comments are an insult to the generations of brave Americans whose blood and sweat and tears built our magnificent country.	0
364	Donald Trump	So this November, you can either vote for the party that says America was never great -- that's going to be their theme now America was never great.	0
365	Donald Trump	Hey, let's do that.	0
366	Donald Trump	They copied mine, Promises Made, Promises Kept.	0
367	Donald Trump	Let's give them a new theme, "America Was Never Great."	0
368	Donald Trump	That's the Democrats' new theme.	0
369	Donald Trump	Can we do that?	0
370	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
371	Donald Trump	We'll retheme their party.	0
372	Donald Trump	Or you can vote proudly for everything that we stand for.	0
373	Donald Trump	We're the greatest country in the world and we are now the greatest economy that we have ever had.	0
374	Donald Trump	We're the greatest economy in the world.	0
375	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants USA]	0
376	Donald Trump	We've gone up $10 trillion in value since my election.	0
377	Donald Trump	We've gone up $10 trillion, think of it, since the election.	0
378	Donald Trump	Was that a great election?	0
379	Donald Trump	Boy.	0
380	Donald Trump	Remember I was here just before the election and I brought a couple of guys into a room and I said, "Fellas, supposing we teach you a new skill, supposing we teach you like how to make little widgets or gidgets or gadgets."	0
381	Donald Trump	These are big, strong coal miners.	0
382	Donald Trump	They said, "Sir, we want to dig coal."	0
383	Donald Trump	I said, "I agree with you."	0
384	Donald Trump	I agree, right?	0
385	Donald Trump	Remember that?	0
386	Donald Trump	Their grandfathers did it.	0
387	Donald Trump	Their fathers did it.	0
388	Donald Trump	That's incredible and it's really happening.	0
389	Donald Trump	We are back.	0
390	Donald Trump	The coal industry is back.	0
391	Donald Trump	So when I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out.	0
392	Donald Trump	It was not doing exactly well, one of the last.	0
393	Donald Trump	Do you know that a few months ago, it hit where West Virginia on a per capita basis is one of the most successful GDP states in our union?	0
394	Donald Trump	So we went from being down and out.	0
395	Donald Trump	You're one of the most successful in the union, very close to the top.	0
396	Donald Trump	That is some big change.	0
397	Donald Trump	And I've had so many people, I was backstage and people are coming up to me, "Mr. President, thank you, sir, for saving our nation," because you understand what that means.	0
398	Donald Trump	We couldn't do anything.	0
399	Donald Trump	Had the other side won, they would have poured on more regulations, raised your taxes.	0
400	Donald Trump	They would have done things that were so bad.	0
401	Donald Trump	You had a very low GDP.	0
402	Donald Trump	It was 1.2%, 1.2%.	0
403	Donald Trump	It was going down.	0
404	Donald Trump	It was going to be a negative.	0
405	Donald Trump	Last quarter, we just hit, as you all know, 4.1%.	0
406	Donald Trump	Nobody thought that was possible.	0
407	Donald Trump	If -- I always said, if I would have ever said that shortly after winning we're going to hit 4.1%, those people back there would have said, "This guy, no good, fake news, fake news."	0
408	Donald Trump	How fake are they?	0
409	Donald Trump	Fake news and the Russian witch hunt?	0
410	Donald Trump	We got a whole big combination.	0
411	Donald Trump	Where is the collusion?	0
412	Donald Trump	You know, they're still looking for collusion.	0
413	Donald Trump	Where is the collusion?	0
414	Donald Trump	Find some collusion.	0
415	Donald Trump	We want to find the collusion.	0
416	Donald Trump	At the beating heart of this election is border security.	0
417	Donald Trump	We have to have that, right?	0
418	Donald Trump	We have to have it.	0
419	Donald Trump	Iowa officials and so many other countries have been reporting numbers where they're having a lot of problems with people coming in.	0
420	Donald Trump	People are coming in, but we're getting them out.	0
421	Donald Trump	We have MS-13 on the run.	0
422	Donald Trump	They poured in here with Obama.	0
423	Donald Trump	We have them on the run because we love the men and women of ICE.	0
424	Donald Trump	A blue wave in November means open borders, which means massive crime.	0
425	Donald Trump	A red wave means safety and strength.	0
426	Donald Trump	That's what it is.	0
427	Donald Trump	The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE.	0
428	Donald Trump	A vote for any Democrat in November is a vote to eliminate immigration enforcement, throw open our borders, and set loose vicious predators and violent criminals.	0
429	Donald Trump	They'll be all over our communities.	0
430	Donald Trump	They will be preying on our communities.	0
431	Donald Trump	Yet while many Democrats are calling to abolish ICE, today our brave ICE officers successfully carried out a 14-year-old deportation order against a Nazi criminal who is living in New York, the last known Nazi officer living in the United States.	0
432	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get him out for decades.	0
433	Donald Trump	President Obama tried.	0
434	Donald Trump	They all tried.	0
435	Donald Trump	We got him out, gone.He's gone.	0
436	Donald Trump	He's back in Germany.	0
437	Donald Trump	ICE officers are heroes who uphold our laws and they really do.	0
438	Donald Trump	They uphold our laws and they defend our communities like nobody you've ever seen.	0
439	Donald Trump	And yes, they're tough, they're strong, they're smart, they have great heart, but they go into these communities loaded up with the kind of criminals you don't want to be dealing with.	0
440	Donald Trump	They walk in like it's another day in the office.	0
441	Donald Trump	They're tougher.	0
442	Donald Trump	They're stronger.	0
443	Donald Trump	It's what these other people fear.	0
444	Donald Trump	And by the way, our ICE folks and our border patrol folks, they have no fear.	0
445	Donald Trump	The job they do is incredible.	0
446	Donald Trump	And by the way, while we're at it, law enforcement, these are great, great people and they're doing an incredible job, right?	0
447	Donald Trump	Every single day, ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers, predators, and killers, and we're either throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country.	0
448	Donald Trump	If you want to save ICE, if you want to protect our border and our border patrol, if you want to stop this craziness of sanctuary cities, where criminals are protected -- take a look at Chicago, how about the mayor of Chicago?	0
449	Donald Trump	It's like a war zone.	0
450	Donald Trump	It's a great city.	0
451	Donald Trump	It's like a war zone.	0
452	Donald Trump	This is what those policies do.	0
453	Donald Trump	Last week, 62 people were shot.	0
454	Donald Trump	Twelve died.	0
455	Donald Trump	This is like our country.	0
456	Donald Trump	There's no reason for this.	0
457	Donald Trump	The Republican Party stands proudly with our courageous ICE officers and border patrol agents.	0
458	Donald Trump	And by the way, you know who wants the wall more than any of us?	0
459	Donald Trump	ICE and border patrol because they know that's going to be a big, big factor in stopping the drugs from coming in, the human traffickers, which is worse all over the world than at any time in the history of our world, human traffickers.	0
460	Donald Trump	Who would believe, and it's because of the internet.	0
461	Donald Trump	This election is about security and this election is also about jobs.	0
462	Donald Trump	Wwe have produced.	0
463	Donald Trump	We have produced.	0
464	Donald Trump	Thanks to Republicans, our economy is booming like it has never boomed before.	0
465	Donald Trump	We've created another number that nobody would have believed if I said it during the campaign: 4 million new jobs since the election.	0
466	Donald Trump	Nobody would have believed it.	0
467	Donald Trump	Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps, think of that.	0
468	Donald Trump	They don't need them because they have a job.	0
469	Donald Trump	They're eating better now.	0
470	Donald Trump	They don't need food stamps, almost 4 million, think of it.	0
471	Donald Trump	Last year in West Virginia, per capita income grew 40% faster than the national average, 40% congratulations.	0
472	Donald Trump	Congratulations.	0
473	Donald Trump	I told you last time I was here, you weren't so happy like you are now.	0
474	Donald Trump	We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide.	0
475	Donald Trump	That number is soon going to exceed 600,000 and our opponent said there's no such thing as manufacturing jobs anymore, right?	0
476	Donald Trump	And I'd say, "Oh I see we're not going to make things any more."	0
477	Donald Trump	Think of it, we'll be close to 600,000 very soon.	0
478	Donald Trump	We have companies pouring into our country.	0
479	Donald Trump	They're coming back.	0
480	Donald Trump	These are companies that left.	0
481	Donald Trump	They're coming back to Michigan.	0
482	Donald Trump	They're coming back to West Virginia.	0
483	Donald Trump	They're coming back to Pennsylvania and Ohio.	0
484	Donald Trump	They're coming to Florida.	0
485	Donald Trump	They're coming back, not just opening.	0
486	Donald Trump	They're coming back.	0
487	Donald Trump	They left and now they're coming back because they want to be where the action is and the action is in the United States of America.	0
488	Donald Trump	So the economic growth, as I said, when it hit 4.1%, everybody was like, "That's amazing," except me, because it's going to go much higher than that.	0
489	Donald Trump	When I finish these trade deals -- and the tariffs are very important -- these companies come in and I say to the European Union, very nice people, I say Jean-Claude, we'd like to negotiate a new trade agreement with the European Union.	0
490	Donald Trump	We lost $151 billion over the last number of years per year.	0
491	Donald Trump	Does anyone know what a $151 billion per year is?	0
492	Donald Trump	And he very respectfully said, "Mr. President, but we are very happy with the deal."	0
493	Donald Trump	I said, "I'd be happy if I were you too.	0
494	Donald Trump	I'd be very happy."	0
495	Donald Trump	I said a second time, a third time, and a fourth time, but they were happy with the deal but we weren't happy because they have barriers up and because they have tariffs, all the things we don't have.	0
496	Donald Trump	You want to build a car and send it to Europe, how many Chevrolets are there in the middle of Berlin?	0
497	Donald Trump	Not too many, maybe one?	0
498	Donald Trump	I doubt it.	0
499	Donald Trump	I don't think you could find the one.	0
500	Donald Trump	So there are barriers so I said, "Come on, let's go."	0
501	Donald Trump	And then he said, "No."	0
502	Donald Trump	I said, "Listen."	0
503	Donald Trump	And I said this to numerous countries, I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to single out anybody, but I said it.	0
504	Donald Trump	Listen, here's what we're going to – it's all about the cars.	0
505	Donald Trump	It's all about the cars, tremendously big industry.	0
506	Donald Trump	We're going to put a 25% tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States and that'll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion and it'll give us a surplus of $151 billion.	0
507	Donald Trump	That's a fairly dramatic swing and that'll take one little signature, Donald J.	0
508	Donald Trump	Trump.	0
509	Donald Trump	And I got a call, "Mr. President, when can we meet?	0
510	Donald Trump	We'd like to see you."	0
511	Donald Trump	And they came, and very respectfully, we're working on a deal.	0
512	Donald Trump	But this is happening all over.	0
513	Donald Trump	Wth China, I have great respect for President Xi, great respect, tremendous respect for China.	0
514	Donald Trump	But they have taken advantage of our country for decades.	0
515	Donald Trump	We have rebuilt China.	0
516	Donald Trump	We have rebuilt China.	0
517	Donald Trump	I used to talk about this.	0
518	Donald Trump	I didn't press it initially because I wanted them to help us with North Korea and they have, and they have, and we're doing well with North Korea.	0
519	Donald Trump	These guys, it's been what three months since I left?	0
520	Donald Trump	These guys say, "What's happening with North Korea?"	0
521	Donald Trump	Hey folks, they've been doing this stuff for 75 years.	0
522	Donald Trump	Three months.	0
523	Donald Trump	What happened?	0
524	Donald Trump	I can tell you and I got along very well with Kim Jong-un.	0
525	Donald Trump	Really well.	0
526	Donald Trump	Good chemistry.	0
527	Donald Trump	Obama was unable to do anything with North Korea and he considered it like -- just read the papers.	0
528	Donald Trump	You'll see what he considered it.	0
529	Donald Trump	So I've been three months.	0
530	Donald Trump	I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim.	0
531	Donald Trump	We'll see what happens.	0
532	Donald Trump	Who knows?	0
533	Donald Trump	Can I be honest?	0
534	Donald Trump	Who knows?	0
535	Donald Trump	But I haven't taken off the sanctions.	0
536	Donald Trump	We have massive sanctions, but I want to take them off quickly.	0
537	Donald Trump	But they've gotta get rid of the nukes.	0
538	Donald Trump	They've gotta get rid of the nukes.	0
539	Donald Trump	Gotta get rid of them.	0
540	Donald Trump	But who knows what's going to happen?	0
541	Donald Trump	I mean, maybe it'll work out, but I think we've done a good job in a short period of time.	0
542	Donald Trump	You remember it started off extremely hostile.	0
543	Donald Trump	Remember they said, "He's going to get us into a war."	0
544	Donald Trump	They thought my rhetoric was too strong.	0
545	Donald Trump	You remember.	0
546	Donald Trump	I won't say it because I don't want to insult Chairman Kim, but you remember, you remember.	0
547	Donald Trump	Elton John, I don't want to insult-- so I'm not going to mention it.	0
548	Donald Trump	But the fake news back there said, "He is going to get us into a war.	0
549	Donald Trump	He's crazy.	0
550	Donald Trump	This guy is crazy.	0
551	Donald Trump	Our president is crazy." And then I went to meet the leaders	0
552	SYSTEM	[ph]	0
553	Donald Trump	and the folks that run NATO, all the leaders of NATO and they weren't paying their bills.	0
554	Donald Trump	They were delinquent.	0
555	Donald Trump	In real estate -- I love real estate -- when somebody doesn't pay their rent, you say – Shelley, you say their delinquent.	0
556	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your rent.	0
557	Donald Trump	And I met him last year and Stoltenberg, secretary general, great guy of NATO.	0
558	Donald Trump	He's my single biggest fan, bigger than any fan I have in the room.	0
559	Donald Trump	You know why?	0
560	Donald Trump	Because nobody was paying their bills.	0
561	Donald Trump	He was in charge of NATO.	0
562	Donald Trump	He couldn't get any money.	0
563	Donald Trump	But last year, I went a year ago, I said you're not paying your bills.	0
564	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your bills.	0
565	Donald Trump	He picked up $44 billion.	0
566	Donald Trump	He told that to the press, they didn't report it.	0
567	Donald Trump	Forty-four billion.	0
568	Donald Trump	And then I just left recently and we're going to pick up at least another close to $100 billion extra.	0
569	Donald Trump	I said to him, "You gotta pay your bills."	0
570	Donald Trump	The United States is paying close to 90% of the cost of protecting Europe, and I think that's wonderful.	1
571	Donald Trump	I said to Europe -- I said, "Folks, NATO's better for you than it is for us.	0
572	Donald Trump	Believe me."	0
573	Donald Trump	And what happened is they asked a question.	0
574	Donald Trump	They have small countries, big countries, all of these countries were – we're supposed to protect them?	0
575	Donald Trump	I said, "Look, it's very simple.	0
576	Donald Trump	You gotta pay up.	0
577	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your bill."	0
578	Donald Trump	And somebody said, "Sir," there's the president of a country calling me sir.	0
579	Donald Trump	That shows respect.	0
580	Donald Trump	I say, "Yes, Mr.	0
581	Donald Trump	President?"	0
582	Donald Trump	He said, "Would you leave us if we don't pay our bills?"	0
583	Donald Trump	Now they hated my answer I said, "Yes, I would have to consider it.	0
584	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your bill."	0
585	Donald Trump	They hated the answer.	0
586	Donald Trump	But if I said, "No, I won't leave you.	0
587	Donald Trump	You don't have to pay your bills.	0
588	Donald Trump	I won't leave.	0
589	Donald Trump	I promise, will always protect you.	0
590	Donald Trump	You will always be protected.	0
591	Donald Trump	Don't pay your bills."	0
592	Donald Trump	Then they're never going to pay their bills.	0
593	Donald Trump	So I said, "Yes, I will leave you if you don't pay your bills" and you could see those checkbooks coming out for billions of dollars.	0
594	Donald Trump	They pay their bills.	0
595	Donald Trump	And I think we'll pick up over the next short while over $100 billion.	0
596	Donald Trump	And then they said the fake news, they said, "President Trump treated the NATO nation leaders" -- in brackets, I put brackets, who have been ripping us off -- treated the NATO leaders with tremendous contempt and disrespect.	0
597	Donald Trump	And I said, "No no, no.	0
598	Donald Trump	They disrespected our country because they weren't paying."	0
599	Donald Trump	Now they're paying.	0
600	Donald Trump	How about if we got into a conflict because a country was attacked and now we're in World War 3 and we're protecting a country that was attacked and didn't pay its bills?	0
601	Donald Trump	I'd feel so stupid.	0
602	Donald Trump	We're protecting a country that wasn't paying its bills.	0
603	Donald Trump	So I got them to pay $100 billion.	0
604	Donald Trump	It's gonna be much more than that, but tremendous amounts of money, tremendous.	0
605	Donald Trump	They gotta pay up, they're paying up.	0
606	Donald Trump	And then they made the statement that I showed great disrespect.	0
607	Donald Trump	But actually, I have a great relationship with all of those people, 28 people, all of them.	0
608	Donald Trump	We have a great relationship because now they respect us.	0
609	Donald Trump	They respect our country again.	0
610	Donald Trump	They didn't respect our country.	0
611	Donald Trump	They didn't respect our country.	0
612	Donald Trump	They respect us again, and you see it with China.	0
613	Donald Trump	China was walking its way down.	0
614	Donald Trump	I don't want them to go down, but they're down close to 30% in three months.	0
615	Donald Trump	I don't want that.	0
616	Donald Trump	I want them to do well.	0
617	Donald Trump	I want to be their friend.	0
618	Donald Trump	But we had to do things that we had to do.	0
619	Donald Trump	When I came, we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time.	0
620	Donald Trump	That's not going to happen anymore.	0
621	Donald Trump	Not going to happen anymore.	0
622	Donald Trump	Good luck to them.	0
623	Donald Trump	The long winding road, you know, the long winding road, and I have tremendous respect for China.	0
624	Donald Trump	I mean, the energy, the genius, it's incredible what they've done.	0
625	Donald Trump	And hopefully we're going to have a great relationship, but we can't do it.	0
626	Donald Trump	It's got to be a two-way street.	0
627	Donald Trump	We have only one-way streets, not only China, with everybody.	0
628	Donald Trump	It's a one-way street, our enemies, our friends, our allies.	0
629	Donald Trump	I mean, our allies treat us worse than our enemies.	0
630	Donald Trump	Believe it.	0
631	Donald Trump	So it's all changing.	0
632	Donald Trump	And when we get those trade deals done properly -- and you know what bothers me?	0
633	Donald Trump	I have people coming to me some people in Congress, "Sir, can you get this deal done immediately?"	0
634	Donald Trump	I say, "It doesn't work that way.	0
635	Donald Trump	I don't want to go too fast.	0
636	Donald Trump	The deal is not going to be any good if we do that.	0
637	Donald Trump	We gotta take time, it's got to gestate, right?"	0
638	Donald Trump	The word gestate, it's like when you're cooking the chicken, time, time, turkey for Thanksgiving.	0
639	Donald Trump	My mother would say, oh eight hours.	0
640	Donald Trump	I said, "Eight hours?"	0
641	Donald Trump	She made the greatest turkey I've ever had, takes time, takes time.	0
642	Donald Trump	So when they run and they say, "Oh, can you do NATO right now?	0
643	Donald Trump	Could we sign it next week?"	0
644	Donald Trump	I said, "Wait a minute.	0
645	Donald Trump	Look, I like Mexico.	0
646	Donald Trump	I like the new leader.	0
647	Donald Trump	I think he's going to be terrific, little different than us."	0
648	Donald Trump	I think I'm doing better with him than with the capitalist.	0
649	Donald Trump	But he knows that Mexico needs the United States.	0
650	Donald Trump	They need the United States.	0
651	Donald Trump	Canada charges us close to 300% tariffs for dairy products going into Canada, which is essentially saying we don't want your dairy products -- this is a wall.	1
652	Donald Trump	They have a wall in a different way.	0
653	Donald Trump	It's called an economic wall.	0
654	Donald Trump	I don't want that.	0
655	Donald Trump	I'd said, "Justin, I mean, I don't want to have too much fun with you, Justin.	0
656	Donald Trump	You can't do that."	0
657	Donald Trump	Justin Trudeau, nice guy, but they've taken advantage of us for so many years that we have to take our time.	0
658	Donald Trump	But with that being said, we're doing very well.	0
659	Donald Trump	We're on our way with a good deal, a fair deal.	0
660	Donald Trump	I don't want a good deal, I want a fair deal for both of us, fair with Mexico.	0
661	Donald Trump	And you've heard me say it.	0
662	Donald Trump	As an example, when China makes a car, they sell it into the United States.	0
663	Donald Trump	There's 2 1/2 percent tariff, of which they don't pay.	0
664	Donald Trump	So they paid nothing.	0
665	Donald Trump	Other than that, it's a wonderful deal.	0
666	Donald Trump	When we make a car, we sell it into China, and there's a 25% tariff.	1
667	Donald Trump	And that's just the beginning, here's others.	0
668	Donald Trump	A man was driving down a street in China and he looked over and it was a Chevrolet, like Camaro, does that make sense?	0
669	Donald Trump	Is it a Camaro?	0
670	Donald Trump	I think it costs $39,000 or $40,000.	0
671	Donald Trump	He's in China.	0
672	Donald Trump	He's in Beijing and he shouts across -- they're stopped -- he then shouts across, "Tell me, how much did that car cost in China?"	0
673	Donald Trump	Guy looks, "$119,000."	0
674	Donald Trump	Now you understand that, right?	0
675	Donald Trump	It's all taxes and taxes and taxes.	0
676	Donald Trump	We can't do that anymore.	0
677	Donald Trump	Can't do it.	0
678	Donald Trump	We are a country with unbelievable potential.	0
679	Donald Trump	We are a country that has been ripped off by everybody, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore.	0
680	Donald Trump	And if it takes me a little angst to tell senators and congressmen and all of the people that really do have your heart in the hands, in many cases -- sometimes I wonder where they're coming from with these suggestions -- but it's going to have to take that little period of time.	0
681	Donald Trump	With that being said, we're moving so fast, nobody could even believe it.	0
682	Donald Trump	And every country wants to make a deal because we're like the big fat piggybank that everybody wants to rob, and we're not going to let them rob us anymore.	0
683	Donald Trump	Is that OK, West Virginia?	0
684	Donald Trump	We're not going to let them rob us anymore.	0
685	Donald Trump	Every day we're keeping our promises.	0
686	Donald Trump	We're canceling Obama's illegal anti-coal destroying regulations, the so-called Clean Power Plan.	0
687	Donald Trump	Doesn't that sound nice?	0
688	Donald Trump	Clean power.	0
689	Donald Trump	You know, when I ended the Paris accord, what's a more beautiful name than the Paris accord?	0
690	Donald Trump	Let's call it the West Virginia accord -- maybe I would have signed it.	0
691	Donald Trump	But when I entered it, that was going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions.	0
692	Donald Trump	And other countries, as an example, China didn't kick in until many years in the future.	0
693	Donald Trump	We kicked in immediately.	0
694	Donald Trump	Russia went back many years, which was not a clean time in terms of the environment because you know what?	0
695	Donald Trump	We all agree, we want a clean environment.	0
696	Donald Trump	We want a strong, beautiful, clean environment.	0
697	Donald Trump	I want clean air.	0
698	Donald Trump	I want crystal clean water, and we've got it.	0
699	Donald Trump	We've got the cleanest country in the planet right now.	0
700	Donald Trump	There's nobody cleaner than us and it's getting better and better.	0
701	Donald Trump	But I'm getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations, which are killing our companies, our states, and our jobs.	0
702	Donald Trump	Just today, we announced our new affordable clean energy proposal that will help our coal-fired power plants and save consumers, you, me, everybody, billions and billions of dollars.	0
703	Donald Trump	We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, and Republicans have passed the biggest tax cuts and reform.	0
704	Donald Trump	The reform is very important.	0
705	Donald Trump	But you know what I've said, I don't want to talk about reform because nobody knows what it means.	0
706	Donald Trump	That could be a tax increase.	0
707	Donald Trump	I said, "How come it's been Ronald Reagan since you got the last big tax cut?"	0
708	Donald Trump	And they looked at me and said, "We don't know."	0
709	Donald Trump	And a lot of the great senators and the congressmen came up to see me and they had the 2018 tax reform.	0
710	Donald Trump	I said, "What the hell does that mean?	0
711	Donald Trump	Are you going to raise taxes?"	0
712	Donald Trump	Then I found out this is what they've done for 40 years, tax reform.	0
713	Donald Trump	I said, "Nobody knows what it means."	0
714	Donald Trump	And we do have reform in there, great reform.	0
715	Donald Trump	But they said nobody knows -- I said, "Nobody knows what it means.	0
716	Donald Trump	Here it is.	0
717	Donald Trump	I want to put it down, tax cuts."	0
718	Donald Trump	They said, "What would be your favorite name Mr.	0
719	Donald Trump	President?"	0
720	Donald Trump	I said, "The tax cut, cut, cut, cut bill."	0
721	Donald Trump	And we almost did it.	0
722	Donald Trump	We almost did it but in all fairness in this case congressmen, a couple of them thought it was a little bit tacky.	0
723	Donald Trump	So we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill.	0
724	Donald Trump	But you know what?	0
725	Donald Trump	We have done great reform.	0
726	Donald Trump	But it's the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and you people are benefiting by it.	0
727	Donald Trump	You're benefiting.	0
728	Donald Trump	And companies are benefiting, and those companies are the ones that are providing all of the jobs.	0
729	Donald Trump	We're setting records on jobs.	0
730	Donald Trump	We're protecting, also so important for West Virginia and a lot of states, we are protecting again religious liberty and we're also standing up to social media censorship.	0
731	Donald Trump	That's the new thing.	0
732	Donald Trump	That's the new thing.	0
733	Donald Trump	I'd rather have fake news like CNN.	0
734	Donald Trump	I would rather have fake news – it's true -- than have anybody, including liberals, socialists, anything, than have anybody stopped and censored.	0
735	Donald Trump	You gotta live -- we gotta live with it.	0
736	Donald Trump	We gotta get used to it.	0
737	Donald Trump	We're going to live with fake news.	0
738	Donald Trump	There's too many sources.Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper.	0
739	Donald Trump	You have Twitter, you have whatever you have, Facebook, but everyone, you can't have censorship.	0
740	Donald Trump	You can't pick one person and say, "Well, we don't like what he's been saying.	0
741	Donald Trump	He's out."	0
742	Donald Trump	So we'll live with fake news.	0
743	Donald Trump	I mean, I hate to say it, but we have no choice because that's by far the better alternative.	0
744	Donald Trump	We can't have people saying censorship because you know what?	0
745	Donald Trump	It can turn it around.	0
746	Donald Trump	It can be them next.	0
747	Donald Trump	It can be them next.	0
748	Donald Trump	We believe in the right of Americans to speak their minds.	0
749	Donald Trump	We repeal the core of Obamacare.	0
750	Donald Trump	I told you, individual mandate -- because we want to give critically ill patients.	0
751	Donald Trump	We have to give them access.	0
752	Donald Trump	We have to give health care to people.	0
753	Donald Trump	We want the right to try.	0
754	Donald Trump	Do you know what the right to try is?	0
755	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get this for 40 years.	0
756	Donald Trump	They couldn't get it.	0
757	Donald Trump	A person is terminally ill, they're terminally ill.	0
758	Donald Trump	They're really sick.	0
759	Donald Trump	And I know people, if they have money, they travel all over the world to try and find a cure.	0
760	Donald Trump	If they don't have money, they die.	0
761	Donald Trump	They die.	0
762	Donald Trump	We have the greatest scientists in the world, that's why China and so many other people, they're trying to -- countries they're trying to steal our technology.	0
763	Donald Trump	We can't let them happen.	0
764	Donald Trump	But we have so many people that want to be able to give -- it's like hope, right to try.	0
765	Donald Trump	I love the name.	0
766	Donald Trump	It's a right to try.	0
767	Donald Trump	They never had it before.	0
768	Donald Trump	So a person is terminally ill and we have a great new drug, but it's going to take another two, three years to have it approved.	0
769	Donald Trump	OK, maybe longer.	0
770	Donald Trump	But the tests are really looking good.	0
771	Donald Trump	And this person is very sick.	0
772	Donald Trump	And this person is going to be dead in 90 days and we couldn't get that drug for that person no matter who you were.	0
773	Donald Trump	And I said, "Wait a minute what's the story with this?"	0
774	Donald Trump	Now, there were a lot of complications because the insurance companies had problems, the medical companies had – everybody.	0
775	Donald Trump	A lot of people didn't want them in the stats, horrible things.	0
776	Donald Trump	But I said, "Well, what's going on?	0
777	Donald Trump	We're going to take the right to try and we went through with the help of Cory, with the help of your great, wonderful -- you are a coal lover, aren't you, huh, Shelley?	0
778	Donald Trump	But with the help of Shelley, soon to be with the help of Patrick Patrick, Patrick, oh, he's going to get a lot of things.He's going to get it.	0
779	Donald Trump	We got it approved.	0
780	Donald Trump	So now if we have a great drug that hasn't been approved and somebody has a certain illness they're going to be able to be -- to try.	0
781	Donald Trump	And you know what?	0
782	Donald Trump	Some of the drugs we have in the pipeline are amazing.	0
783	Donald Trump	It's going to work for a lot of people and it's going to give them hope.	0
784	Donald Trump	It's going to give them hope, big deal.	0
785	Donald Trump	We've just secured $6 billion to fight the opioid epidemic.	0
786	Donald Trump	And I know in West Virginia, that's a big deal, right?	0
787	Donald Trump	That's a big deal.We confirmed a record number of Circuit Court judges, it's a record and it's going bigger and bigger.	0
788	Donald Trump	We have a lot of them in the line if Schumer would ever get them approved.	0
789	Donald Trump	He's not exactly thrilled about approving them, that I can tell you.	0
790	Donald Trump	We confirmed the great deal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
791	Donald Trump	And as I just said, Justice Kavanagh is doing great.	0
792	Donald Trump	Looks like I had a very tough Central Casting.	0
793	Donald Trump	How do you vote against him?	0
794	Donald Trump	But the Democrats may find a way.	0
795	Donald Trump	We've secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion for next year, billion with a b.	0
796	Donald Trump	Our military will be stronger and bigger and better and more sophisticated than it's ever been, ever.	0
797	Donald Trump	And hopefully we'll never have to use it.	0
798	Donald Trump	You don't get a lot of good fighters out here.	0
799	Donald Trump	I see some of them.	0
800	Donald Trump	I know some of them.	0
801	Donald Trump	And the one thing about a fighter or a nation or whatever you want, the stronger your military, the better chance you have of never having to use it.	0
802	Donald Trump	We don't want to use it.	0
803	Donald Trump	We don't want to use it.	0
804	Donald Trump	And all of that equipment is being built right here in the U.S.A. We make the greatest fighter jets in the world.We make the greatest ships in the world.	0
805	Donald Trump	We make the greatest missiles and rockets.	0
806	Donald Trump	Nobody does it like us.	0
807	Donald Trump	And in my direction, The Pentagon is working hard to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the space force.That's very exciting.	0
808	Donald Trump	We need it.	0
809	Donald Trump	That's the new frontier, and I'm not just talking about sending rockets to the Moon.	0
810	Donald Trump	I'm talking about militarily.That's where it's at.	0
811	Donald Trump	Thanks to the leadership of U.N.	0
812	Donald Trump	Ambassador Nikki Haley.	0
813	Donald Trump	We've reduced the United Nations spending by $1.3 billion saving U.S. taxpayers $350 million.	0
814	Donald Trump	Just came out, but nobody wants to ride it.	0
815	Donald Trump	We just passed the landmark VA accountability law.That's where people that don't treat our vets properly, we look at them and we say, "You're fired.	0
816	Donald Trump	Get the hell out."	0
817	Donald Trump	45 years they have been trying to pass it.	0
818	Donald Trump	45 years they've tried the pass it.	0
819	Donald Trump	We also passed veterans choice so that if our veterans can't get the care they need, they have the right to see a private doctor.	0
820	Donald Trump	They don't have to wait in line for three weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, two months.	0
821	Donald Trump	I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal.	0
822	Donald Trump	And this month, we reimposed tough sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and on Iran.	0
823	Donald Trump	I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.	0
824	Donald Trump	And I understand now what happened because every president – many, many presidents.	0
825	Donald Trump	They said, "We're going to do it.	0
826	Donald Trump	We're going to move our embassy to Jerusalem.	0
827	Donald Trump	It's going to be the capital of Israel, and we're going to do it."	0
828	Donald Trump	We're going do it, and then they don't do it.	0
829	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
830	Donald Trump	Politicians, they don't do it.	0
831	Donald Trump	So I said, I'm going do it during the campaign.I said it right here in West Virginia.	0
832	Donald Trump	And I now understand why many, many presidents before me said they were going to do it and didn't do it because I was inundated with calls from foreign leaders, every country.	0
833	Donald Trump	Don't do it.	0
834	Donald Trump	Don't do it.	0
835	Donald Trump	Don't do it.	0
836	Donald Trump	Please don't do it, don't do it.	0
837	Donald Trump	And so actually, what I did, I was about five days off.I stopped taking calls.	0
838	Donald Trump	I said, "I'll call you back next week," because I knew what they were going to ask me.	0
839	Donald Trump	It's much easier if it was, oopsie, I didn't know you're always calling for that reason.	0
840	Donald Trump	So I approved it, and it should have been done years ago.	0
841	Donald Trump	And if there's ever going to be peace, remember I said it, with the Palestinians, it was a good thing to have done because we took it off the table.	0
842	Donald Trump	Because every time they were peace talks, they never got past Jerusalem becoming the capital.	0
843	Donald Trump	So I said, let's take it off the table.	0
844	Donald Trump	And you know what, in the negotiation, Israel will have to pay a higher price because they want a very big thing, but I took it off the table.	0
845	Donald Trump	They could never get by.You understand that Cory.	0
846	Donald Trump	You both understand that.	0
847	Donald Trump	Shelley?	0
848	Donald Trump	They could never get past the fact of Jerusalem becoming the capital.	0
849	Donald Trump	Now it's off the table.	0
850	Donald Trump	There's nothing to negotiate.	0
851	Donald Trump	But they'll get something very good because it's their turn next.	0
852	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.	0
853	Donald Trump	It's very – I've always heard that's the toughest deal of all deals that's called peace between Israel and the Palestinians.	0
854	Donald Trump	They say that's the toughest of all deals.	0
855	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.	0
856	Donald Trump	Instead of apologize, that's -- what we're doing is we're winning.	0
857	Donald Trump	Instead of apologizing from that, we're standing up for America and we're standing up for the heroes who defend our country, but to continue this incredible success, we must elect more Republicans.We must elect Patrick Morrisey.	0
858	Donald Trump	We need him.	0
859	Donald Trump	We need Patrick.	0
860	Donald Trump	So get your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers, your family members, get the people that love our country and get out to vote.	0
861	Donald Trump	We need his vote so badly.	0
862	Donald Trump	We need his energy.	0
863	Donald Trump	You're going to see this guy has energy.	0
864	Donald Trump	Loyal citizens like you helped to build this country.	0
865	Donald Trump	Together we're taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs, to the American people.	0
866	Donald Trump	From Morgantown to Madison to Charleston, this great state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women who tamed the wilderness to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible American families.	0
867	Donald Trump	They didn't have a lot of money.	0
868	Donald Trump	They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had grit and they had faith and they loved each other.	0
869	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what, they were smart.	0
870	Donald Trump	They are smart.	0
871	Donald Trump	We're the smart ones, remember.	0
872	Donald Trump	I say it all the time.You hear the elite.	0
873	Donald Trump	They're not elite, we're elite.	0
874	Donald Trump	You're smarter than they are, you have more money than they are, you have better jobs than they do, you'rethe elite.	0
875	Donald Trump	So let them have the word elite.	0
876	Donald Trump	You're the super elite.That's what it is.	0
877	Donald Trump	I always hate -- I always hate when they say, well the elite decided not to go to something I'm doing, right, the elite.	0
878	Donald Trump	I said, "Well, I have a lot more money than they do.	0
879	Donald Trump	I have a much better education than they have.I'm smarter than they are.	0
880	Donald Trump	I have many much more beautiful homes than they do.	0
881	Donald Trump	I have a better apartment at the top of Fifth Avenue.	0
882	Donald Trump	Why the hell are they the elite?	0
883	Donald Trump	Tell me.	0
884	Donald Trump	Because you are the elite.	0
885	Donald Trump	Just remember that.	0
886	Donald Trump	You are the elite.	0
887	Donald Trump	They're not the elite.	0
888	Donald Trump	That's just a name.	0
889	Donald Trump	Aren't you insulted when they say the elite?	0
890	Donald Trump	To me, I'm insulted, always insulted.	0
891	Donald Trump	They're the elite, they're not the elite.	0
892	Donald Trump	Your people and the people that preceded you in West Virginia were the Carpenters and the coal miners, the ministers, the metal workers, the farmers, the factory workers, but they all had one thing in common.	0
893	Donald Trump	They love their families, they love their country, and they love their God.	0
894	Donald Trump	We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to fight and they knew how to win.	0
895	Donald Trump	We're winning again.	0
896	Donald Trump	We're winning again.	0
897	Donald Trump	Just like them we're going to keep on fighting and we're going to keep on winning and we're going to win for our nation, our children, our families and we're going to win for our continued freedom.	0
898	Donald Trump	I joke that I'll have Patrick Morriseycoming to me soon.	0
899	Donald Trump	He'll be your senator and he'll say, "Mr. President, the people of West Virginia can't stand winning so much.	0
900	Donald Trump	They haven't won in decades and now you're winning with coal, you're winning with everything."	0
901	Donald Trump	He's going say – Patrick, he's going to say, "Mr. President, please they don't want to win so much.	0
902	Donald Trump	They can't stand it.	0
903	Donald Trump	Please you're winning too much for West Virginia.	0
904	Donald Trump	Please stop winning."	0
905	Donald Trump	And I'm going to say, "Patrick.	0
906	Donald Trump	I'm sorry.	0
907	Donald Trump	I don't care what the hell the people of West Virginia want.	0
908	Donald Trump	We're going to keep on winning anyway, because I believe that's what they want."	0
909	Donald Trump	Right?	0
910	Donald Trump	That's what they want because the people of West Virginia never give up.	0
911	Donald Trump	They never given and they never back down because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.	0
912	Donald Trump	We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.	0
913	Donald Trump	And together we will make America wealthy again.	0
914	Donald Trump	That's happening.	0
915	Donald Trump	That's happening a lot faster than the fake news ever said it could happen.	0
916	Donald Trump	We will make America strong again.	0
917	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again and we will make America great again.	0
918	Donald Trump	Thank you, West Virginia.	0
919	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
