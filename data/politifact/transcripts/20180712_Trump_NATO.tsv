1	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much, everybody.	0
2	Donald Trump	Appreciate it.	0
3	Donald Trump	We've had a very amazing two-day period in Brussels.	0
4	Donald Trump	And we really accomplished a lot, with respect to NATO.	0
5	Donald Trump	For years, Presidents have been coming to these meetings and talked about the expense -- the tremendous expense for the United States.	0
6	Donald Trump	And tremendous progress has been made; everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment.	0
7	Donald Trump	They're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before.	0
8	Donald Trump	Prior to last year, where I attended my first meeting, it was going down -- the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially.	1
9	Donald Trump	And now, it's going up very substantially.	1
10	Donald Trump	And commitments were made.	0
11	Donald Trump	Only 5 of 29 countries were making their commitment.	0
12	Donald Trump	And that's now changed.	0
13	Donald Trump	The commitment was at 2 percent.	0
14	Donald Trump	Ultimately, that'll be going up quite a bit higher than that.	0
15	Donald Trump	So we are -- we made a tremendous amount of progress today.	0
16	Donald Trump	It's been about, at a minimum, they estimate -- and they're going to be giving you exact numbers -- but since last year, they've raise an additional $33 billion that's been put up by the various countries, not including the United States.	0
17	Donald Trump	And the United States' commitment to NATO is very strong, remains very strong, but primarily because everyone -- the spirit they have, the amount of money they're willing to spend, the additional money that they will be putting up has been really, really amazing to see it.	0
18	Donald Trump	To see the level of spirit in that room is incredible.	0
19	Donald Trump	And I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia.	0
20	Donald Trump	I think that we probably will be able to.	0
21	Donald Trump	The people in the room think so, but they nevertheless -- they really stepped up their commitment, and stepped it up like they never have before. So took in an addition $33	0
22	SYSTEM	[billion]	0
23	Donald Trump	. The number could actually be higher than $40	0
24	SYSTEM	[billion]	0
25	Donald Trump	when they give you the final number.	0
26	Donald Trump	The Secretary General, Stoltenberg, will be giving those numbers sometime today, probably in his concluding press statement.	0
27	Donald Trump	But we are doing numbers like they've never done before or ever seen before.	0
28	Donald Trump	And you'll be seeing that, and I guess you'll be hearing that a little bit later.	0
29	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
30	Donald Trump	We have our Secretary of State, as you know, and we have -- John is here.	0
31	Donald Trump	So if you have any questions for the three of us.	0
32	Donald Trump	Mike Pompeo just got back from a third trip, as you know, to North Korea.	0
33	Donald Trump	He's become a true expert on the trips to North Korea -- the best way to get there, the best way to get out.	0
34	Donald Trump	And he gets along very well.	0
35	Donald Trump	And he's doing a great job over there.	0
36	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.	0
37	Question	I have a question.	0
38	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
39	Tara McKelvey	Mr. President, I'm Tara McKelvey with the BBC.	0
40	Tara McKelvey	Can you tell us whether or not you warned people that the U.S. would pull out of NATO if they weren't meeting their spending goals?	0
41	Donald Trump	I told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially, because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.	0
42	Donald Trump	And now, people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitments.	0
43	Donald Trump	So I let them know yesterday, actually.	0
44	Donald Trump	I was surprised that you didn't pick it up; it took until today.	0
45	Donald Trump	But yesterday, I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening, and they have substantially upped their commitment, yeah.	0
46	Donald Trump	And now we're very happy and have a very, very powerful, very, very strong NATO, much stronger than it was two days ago.	0
47	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.	0
48	Question	Hi, President Trump.	0
49	Donald Trump	Yes, hi.	0
50	Donald Trump	How are you?	0
51	Question	I'm the White House Correspondent for PBS --	0
52	Donald Trump	I know.	0
53	Donald Trump	You're very famous on television.	0
54	Question	I have a question, again, about -- did you ever, at any point, say that the U.S., though, might stop engaging with NATO?	0
55	Question	And do you think that your rhetoric helps NATO cohesion, or are you worried that people might think that U.S. might not be as committed to NATO?	0
56	Question	There are a lot of people who say they were worried and stressed by what you did yesterday.	0
57	Donald Trump	Well, they were probably worried because the United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are, because the commitment has been upped so much.	0
58	Donald Trump	So now they are.	0
59	Donald Trump	And I was very firm yesterday.	0
60	Donald Trump	You have to understand, I know a lot of the people in the room.	0
61	Donald Trump	I was here last year.	0
62	Donald Trump	I let them know last year -- in a less firm manner, but pretty firm -- and they raised an additional $33 billion, I think going to $40 billion.	0
63	Donald Trump	But it's $33 billion as of today.	0
64	Donald Trump	And then today and yesterday, I was probably a little bit more firm.	0
65	Donald Trump	But I believe in NATO.	0
66	Donald Trump	I think NATO is a very important -- probably the greatest ever done.	0
67	Donald Trump	But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate.	1
68	Donald Trump	That's not fair to the United States.	0
69	Donald Trump	In addition to that, as you know, we're in negotiations with the EU, and we're going to be meeting with them next week.	0
70	Donald Trump	We've been treated very unfairly on trade.	0
71	Donald Trump	Our farmers have been shut out of the European Union.	0
72	Donald Trump	Now, you could say they're different, but basically, to a large extent, they're the same countries.	0
73	Donald Trump	So I think we're going to be ultimately treated fairly on trade.	0
74	Donald Trump	We'll see what happens, but I can tell you that NATO now is really a fine-tuned machine.	0
75	Donald Trump	People are paying money that they never paid before.	0
76	Donald Trump	They're happy to do it.	0
77	Donald Trump	And the United States is being treated much more fairly.	0
78	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.	0
79	Ryan Chilcote	President Trump, Ryan Chilcote, PBS NewsHour.	0
80	Ryan Chilcote	Did you win concessions in your meetings and discussions with the German Chancellor when it comes to German defense spending and also with this issue of purchasing energy from Russia?	0
81	Ryan Chilcote	And secondly, what would you say to your critics that say by creating this scene here at NATO you're only enabling President Putin and Russia to further disturb things in Ukraine and Georgia?	0
82	Donald Trump	Well, if you consider putting up tremendously -- you know, the additional funds at a level that nobody has ever seen before, I don't think that's helping Russia.	0
83	Donald Trump	I think that NATO is much stronger now than it was two days ago.	0
84	Donald Trump	I think that NATO was not doing what they were supposed to be doing -- a lot of the countries.	0
85	Donald Trump	And we were doing much more than we should have been doing.	0
86	Donald Trump	Frankly, we were carrying too much of a burden.	0
87	Donald Trump	That's why we call it "burden-sharing."	0
88	Donald Trump	I was using the term a lot today.	0
89	Donald Trump	Burden-sharing.	0
90	Donald Trump	We had a fantastic meeting at the end -- 29 countries.	0
91	Donald Trump	And they are putting up a lot.	0
92	Donald Trump	Germany has increased very substantially their time period, and Germany is coming along.	0
93	Donald Trump	And we still have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline, because the pipeline is coming in from Russia.	0
94	Donald Trump	So we're going to have to figure that out.	0
95	Donald Trump	I brought it up; nobody brought it up but me, and we all are talking about it now.	0
96	Donald Trump	And actually, I think the world is talking about it now maybe more than anything else.	0
97	Donald Trump	But we're going to figure that out.	0
98	Donald Trump	But -- and, frankly, maybe everybody is going to have a good relationship with Russia so there will be a lot less problem with the pipeline.	0
99	Donald Trump	But, to me, that was a very major point of contention.	0
100	Donald Trump	We discussed it at length today.	0
101	Donald Trump	Germany has agreed to do a lot better than they were doing, and we're very happy with that.	0
102	Donald Trump	We had a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.	0
103	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
104	Margaret Talev	Mr. President --	0
105	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.	0
106	Margaret Talev	Hi.	0
107	Margaret Talev	Thank you.	0
108	Margaret Talev	Margaret Talev from Bloomberg.	0
109	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
110	Donald Trump	After all these years, I know, Margaret.	0
111	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
112	Margaret Talev	Thank you.	0
113	Margaret Talev	Maybe I'm being dense here, but could you just clarify: Are you still threatening to potentially pull the United States out of NATO for any reason?	0
114	Margaret Talev	And do you believe you can do that without Congress's explicit support and approval?	0
115	Donald Trump	I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary.	0
116	Donald Trump	And the people have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.	0
117	Donald Trump	And remember the word -- $33 billion more, they're paying.	0
118	Donald Trump	And you'll hear that from the Secretary General in a little while.	0
119	Donald Trump	He thanked me actually.	0
120	Donald Trump	He actually thanked me.	0
121	Donald Trump	And everybody in the room thanked me.	0
122	Donald Trump	There's a great collegial spirit in that room that I don't think they've had in many years.	0
123	Donald Trump	They're very strong.	0
124	Donald Trump	So, yeah, very unified, very strong.	0
125	Donald Trump	No problem.	0
126	Donald Trump	Right?	0
127	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.	0
128	Jonathan Lemire	We're in NATO.	0
129	Jonathan Lemire	No -- no --	0
130	Donald Trump	No problem.	0
131	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
132	Jonathan Lemire	Mr. President, Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press.	0
133	Jonathan Lemire	You have said previously you wanted the countries to step up their spending to 2 percent.	0
134	Jonathan Lemire	Yesterday there was a suggestion it might be 4 percent, or perhaps 2 percent at a much quicker timetable.	0
135	Jonathan Lemire	Can you clarify, what did they commit to doing?	0
136	Jonathan Lemire	Is that satisfactory to you?	0
137	Donald Trump	So what they're doing is spending at a much faster clip.	0
138	Donald Trump	They're going up to the 2 percent level.	0
139	Donald Trump	Now, you have to understand, some of them have parliaments, they have their own congresses, they have a lot of things they have to go through.	0
140	Donald Trump	So, you know, they're here as prime minister or a as a president, and they can't necessarily go in and say, this is what we're going to do.	0
141	Donald Trump	But they're going back for approvals.	0
142	Donald Trump	Some are at 2 percent; others have agreed definitely to go to 2 percent.	0
143	Donald Trump	And some are going back to get the approval, and which they will get, to go to 2 percent.	0
144	Donald Trump	After the 2 percent, we'll start talking about going higher.	0
145	Donald Trump	But I said, ultimately we should be, in years -- in advance -- we should be at 4 percent.	0
146	Donald Trump	I think 4 percent, it's the right number.	0
147	Donald Trump	Now, the United States -- depending on the way you calculate it -- was at 4.2 percent.	0
148	Donald Trump	And I said, that's unfair.	0
149	Donald Trump	And we have the largest GDP by far, especially since we've increased it by so much since a thing called the election.	0
150	Donald Trump	Our GDP has gone way up.	0
151	Donald Trump	And so the fact that our GDP went way up, that means we're paying for even more, which is very unfair.	0
152	Donald Trump	So I explained that.	0
153	Donald Trump	We will go to much higher than 2 percent into the future, but right now we're getting people up to 2 percent, and that will take place over a fairly short period of time -- a short number of years.	0
154	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
155	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead. Hi, Tomas LeCrass from	0

164	Tomas LeCrass	Thank you.	0
165	Donald Trump	No, that's other people that do that.	0

172	Jeremy Diamond	Thank you, sir.	0
173	Jeremy Diamond	Jeremy Diamond with CNN.	0
174	Jeremy Diamond	How are you?	0
175	Donald Trump	Hi, Jeremy.	0
176	Jeremy Diamond	Quick question with regards to Germany and the comments that you made yesterday.	0
177	Jeremy Diamond	Do you feel like given the threats that you made about potentially leaving NATO, about insulting Germany's sovereignty, it appears, by suggesting that they're totally controlled by Russia -- do you feel like that's an effective way to conduct diplomacy?	0
178	Jeremy Diamond	And secondly, would you be able to be a little bit more specific about the commitments that you secured today with regards to increasing the financial commitment?	0
179	Jeremy Diamond	Is there an updated timeline?	0
180	Jeremy Diamond	Are there specific countries you could cite?	0
181	Jeremy Diamond	Because a majority of them were already planning to meet that 2 percent threshold by 2024.	0
182	Donald Trump	No, many of them -- in fact, Germany was going to be in the year 2028 or '30.	0
183	Donald Trump	Yeah, I think it's a very effective way to deal, but I didn't deal exactly the way you said.	0
184	Donald Trump	I have great respect for Germany.	0
185	Donald Trump	My father is from Germany.	0
186	Donald Trump	Both of my parents are from the EU, despite the fact they don't treat us well on trade.	0
187	Donald Trump	But I think that will change also, and I think we'll see that -- because on the 25th of July, they're coming in to start negotiations with me.	0
188	Donald Trump	We'll see.	0
189	Donald Trump	And if they don't negotiate in good faith, we'll do something having to do with all of the millions of cars that are coming into our country and being taxed at a virtually zero level, at a very low level.	0
190	Donald Trump	But, Jeremy, I think it's been a very effective way of negotiating.	0
191	Donald Trump	But I'm not negotiating; I just want fairness for the United States.	0
192	Donald Trump	We're paying for far too much of NATO.	0
193	Donald Trump	NATO is very important.	0
194	Donald Trump	But NATO is helping Europe more than it's helping us.	0
195	Donald Trump	At the same time, it's very good for us.	0
196	Donald Trump	So we have now got it to a point where people are paying a lot more money, and that's starting -- really, last year.	0
197	Donald Trump	It really had -- you were there last year.	0
198	Donald Trump	And last year we had a big impact.	0
199	Donald Trump	Again, we took in $33 billion more.	0
200	Donald Trump	And if you ask Secretary General Stoltenberg, he gives us total credit -- meaning me, I guess, in this case, total credit -- because I said it was unfair.	0
201	Donald Trump	Now, what has happened is, presidents over many years, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, they came in, they said, "Okay, hey, do the best you can," and they left.	0
202	Donald Trump	Nobody did anything about it.	0
203	Donald Trump	And it got to a point where the United States was paying for 90 percent of NATO.	0
204	Donald Trump	And that's not fair.	0
205	Donald Trump	So it's changed	0
206	Donald Trump	We had a really good meeting today.	0
207	Donald Trump	We had a great meeting in terms of getting along.	0
208	Donald Trump	I know most of the people in the room because of last year, because of the year and a half that we've been in office -- year and a half-plus.	0
209	Donald Trump	But we have a great relationship.	0
210	Donald Trump	Everybody in that room, by the time we left, got along.	0
211	Donald Trump	And they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly.	0
212	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead, Phil.	0
213	Philip Rucker	Thanks, Mr. President.	0
214	Philip Rucker	Philip Rucker from the Washington Post.	0
215	Philip Rucker	You tweeted yesterday, "What good is NATO?"	0
216	Philip Rucker	And you've talked about NATO as an alliance that benefits Europe, that defends and protects Europe.	0
217	Philip Rucker	Do you see any value of NATO to the United States vis-a-vis Russia?	0
218	Philip Rucker	Does it help protect the United States from Russia, in your view?	0
219	Donald Trump	I think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries.	0
220	Donald Trump	I think it's -- the way we have it now, I think it's a much -- I think NATO got -- you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office.	0
221	Donald Trump	The numbers were going down.	0
222	Donald Trump	Now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship.	0
223	Donald Trump	The numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly.	0
224	Donald Trump	And they're now going up further.	0
225	Donald Trump	So I think NATO is going to be very, very effective.	0
226	Donald Trump	I'm very impressed with -- and really know, and he's a friend mine -- but Secretary General Stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together.	0
227	Donald Trump	And we were the ones that really -- we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know.	0
228	Donald Trump	I think he's done a really good job.	0
229	Donald Trump	I think that when I was saying that I am very concerned with the pipeline, I don't like the pipeline.	0
230	Donald Trump	And when I talk about NATO, I say, how do you have NATO?	0
231	Donald Trump	And then you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against.	0
232	Donald Trump	But maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against.	0
233	Donald Trump	I think that's a real possibility.	0
234	Donald Trump	As you know, I'm meeting with President Putin on Monday.	0
235	Donald Trump	And I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much.	0
236	Donald Trump	We want to find out about Syria.	0
237	Donald Trump	We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling.	0
238	Donald Trump	I will be asking that question again.	0
239	Donald Trump	But we'll also be talking about other things.	0
240	Donald Trump	We'll be talking about Ukraine.	0
241	Donald Trump	Ukraine was here today, by the way.	0

250	Donald Trump	I mean, it's one of those things.	0
251	Donald Trump	All I can do is say, "Did you" and "Don't do it again."	0
252	Donald Trump	But he may deny it.	0

260	Robert Wall	How will you up the pressure to make them actually?	0
261	Donald Trump	Well, they will.	0
262	Donald Trump	They will.	0
263	Donald Trump	I have no doubt about it.	0
264	Donald Trump	They all made commitments.	0
265	Donald Trump	And they will be up to 2 percent.	0
266	Donald Trump	It will be over a period -- a relatively short period of years.	0

297	Question	Will you recognize --	0
298	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
299	Question	Will you recognize Russia's annex -- will you recognize Crimea as part of Russia when you meet President --	0
300	Donald Trump	Oh, that's an interesting question -- because long before I got here, President Obama allowed that to happen.	0
301	Donald Trump	That was on his watch, not on my watch.	0
302	Donald Trump	You know, people like to say, "Oh, Crimea."	0
303	Donald Trump	But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea.	0
304	Donald Trump	They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago.	0
305	Donald Trump	They built, I think, a submarine port; substantially added billions of dollars.	0
306	Donald Trump	So that was on Barack Obama's watch.	0
307	Donald Trump	That was not on Trump's watch.	0
308	Donald Trump	Would I have allowed it to happen?	0
309	Donald Trump	No, I would not have allowed it to happen.	0
310	Donald Trump	But he did allow it to happen, so that was his determination.	0
311	Donald Trump	What will happen with Crimea from this point on?	0
312	Donald Trump	That I can't tell you.	0
313	Donald Trump	But I'm not happy about Crimea.	0
314	Donald Trump	But again, that was on Barack Obama's watch, not Trump's watch.	0
315	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.	0
316	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
317	Jeff Mason	It's Jeff Mason from Reuters, Mr. President.	0
318	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
319	Donald Trump	I know, Jeff.	0
320	Jeff Mason	Regarding your summit with President Putin, will you be raising arms control issues?	0
321	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
322	Question	Would you like to extend New START?	0
323	Question	And will you raise concerns about violations of the INF Treaty?	0
324	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
325	Jeff Mason	And as a follow-up to the NATO meeting today, will you suggest to him, or would you consider stopping military exercises in the Baltic States, if that's something that he requests?	0
326	Donald Trump	Well, perhaps we'll talk about that.	0
327	Donald Trump	But I will say that we are going to be talking about those three issues and many more.	0
328	Donald Trump	We'll be talking about it, Jeff.	0

337	Question	I would like to know if you are planning to guarantee the taxpayers that the new money that is flowing into NATO will be spent in the best possible way, especially the money coming from country that have several problem with the public finances.	0
338	Donald Trump	Well, the money will be spent properly.	0
339	Donald Trump	And one of the things that we have -- we have many wealthy countries with us today, but we have some that aren't so wealthy.	0
340	Donald Trump	And they did ask if they could buy the military equipment and could I help them out.	0
341	Donald Trump	And we will help them out a little bit.	0
342	Donald Trump	We're not going to finance it for them, but we'll make sure that they're able to get payments and various other things so they can buy.	0
343	Donald Trump	Because the United States makes, by far, the best military equipment in the world.	0
344	Donald Trump	The best jets, the best missiles, the best guns.	0
345	Donald Trump	The best everything -- we make, by far.	0
346	Donald Trump	I mean, that's one thing -- I guess I assumed it prior to taking office, but I really learned, since being President, our equipment is so much better than anybody else's equipment when you look at our companies -- Lockheed and Boeing and Grumman.	0
347	Donald Trump	The material -- the equipment that we make is so far superior, everybody wants to buy our equipment.	0
348	Donald Trump	In fact, it's the question, can they make it?	0
349	Donald Trump	Because they are doing very well.	0
350	Donald Trump	Can they make it for so many people?	0
351	Donald Trump	So we are helping some of those countries get on line and buy the best equipment.	0
352	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.	0
353	Kristin Brown	Hi, I'm Kristin Brown with Fox News.	0
354	Kristin Brown	On your upcoming summit with President Putin, did any of your allies here express any specific concerns or talk to you about any messages that they'd like you to take with you when you go to the summit?	0
355	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
356	Donald Trump	Just the opposite of concern.	0
357	Donald Trump	They actually -- and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict -- but they actually thanked me for meeting with President Putin.	0
358	Donald Trump	I look forward to the meeting.	0
359	Donald Trump	They thanked me.	0
360	Donald Trump	They thought it was a great thing that I was doing it.	0
361	Donald Trump	And they gave us our best wishes, or their best wishes.	0
362	Donald Trump	Now, with that being said, we'll see that happens.	0
363	Donald Trump	Just a loose meeting.	0
364	Donald Trump	It's not going to be big schedule.	0
365	Donald Trump	I don't think it should take a very long period of time.	0
366	Donald Trump	And we'll see where it leads.	0
367	Donald Trump	But it could lead to productive -- something very productive.	0
368	Donald Trump	And maybe it's not.	0
369	Donald Trump	But I think meeting with people is great.	0
370	Donald Trump	We had a great meeting with Chairman Kim.	0
371	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, Mike Pompeo did a fantastic job.	0
372	Donald Trump	I might ask you to say a few words, Mike, while you're here.	0
373	Donald Trump	Just one second.	0
374	Donald Trump	Mike, go ahead.	0
375	Mike Pompeo	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
376	Mike Pompeo	So, I did.	0
377	Mike Pompeo	I returned -- I actually came straight from North Korea with a couple of stops here to Brussels.	0
378	Mike Pompeo	We had a productive conversation.	0
379	Mike Pompeo	There remains a great deal of work to do, but I think, most importantly, my counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, made a commitment consistent with what President Trump was able to achieve with Chairman Kim, which was: They intend to denuclearize.	0
380	Mike Pompeo	They're going to accomplish it.	0
381	Mike Pompeo	And now the task is to get it implemented.	0
382	Donald Trump	I think, just to finish on that, you know, it's so important.	0
383	Donald Trump	That was an amazing -- really, an amazing meeting, I though.	0
384	Donald Trump	And I really think that we established a very good relationship.	0
385	Donald Trump	We'll see where it all ends.	0
386	Donald Trump	But there have been no missile tests.	0
387	Donald Trump	There have been no research.	0
388	Donald Trump	Where there has been -- they have blown up a site; I hear they're blowing up another site, missile site.	0
389	Donald Trump	They've taken down all of the propaganda.	0
390	Donald Trump	In fact, somebody said there's no more music playing at the border line.	0
391	Donald Trump	You know, the music was going on for many years.	0
392	Donald Trump	They said recently that, "Wow, there's no more of the heavy music and the propaganda."	0
393	Donald Trump	They've done a lot of things.	0
394	Donald Trump	And we got back our three hostages.	0
395	Donald Trump	So it's a good process.	0
396	Donald Trump	But the main thing is there have been no rocket launches.	0
397	Donald Trump	There have been no missile tests.	0
398	Donald Trump	There's been no nuclear tests, no explosions, no nothing, for almost nine months.	0
399	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
400	Donald Trump	Yeah, please.	0

402	Ewen MacAskill	Your trip to the UK, there are lots of protests planned in London and elsewhere.	0
403	Ewen MacAskill	How do you feel about that?	0
404	Donald Trump	I think it's fine.	0
405	Donald Trump	I mean, I think they like me a lot in the UK.	0
406	Donald Trump	I think they agree with me on immigration.	0
407	Donald Trump	I'm very strong on immigration.	0
408	Donald Trump	I made a point today -- I said, you've got to stop.	0
409	Donald Trump	You're ruining your -- you're going to have a lot of problems.	0
410	Donald Trump	You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration.	0
411	Donald Trump	I probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration.	0
412	Donald Trump	If you look at Italy -- Giuseppe, who I got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on Italy.	0
413	Donald Trump	I think that a lot of the people in the UK -- I think that's why Brexit happened.	0
414	Donald Trump	Now, I don't know what's going on with the negotiation.	0
415	Donald Trump	Who knows.	0
416	Donald Trump	But -- and I guess that's become a very interesting point of contention	0
417	Donald Trump	I said I'm going to a few hotspots.	0
418	Donald Trump	We have NATO, then we have the UK, and then we have Putin.	0
419	Donald Trump	And I said, Putin may be the easiest of them all.	0
420	Donald Trump	You never know.	0
421	Donald Trump	But I'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations.	0
422	Donald Trump	But I will say that immigration is a very important thing, and I told them today, the EU -- the European Union -- better be very careful, because immigration is taking over Europe, and they better be very, very careful.	0
423	Donald Trump	And I said that loud and clear.	0
424	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead. President Trump,	0

426	Donald Trump	Romania.	0
427	Question	What will you tell President Putin about this summit and about NATO?	0
428	Donald Trump	Well, I think he's going to see about this summit -- this has turned out to be a very successful summit.	0
429	Donald Trump	This is -- I think, really, that NATO is more put together right now, is more coordinated.	0
430	Donald Trump	And I think there's a better spirit for NATO right now than perhaps they've ever had.	0
431	Donald Trump	It's richer than it ever was.	0
432	Donald Trump	The commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made.	0
433	Donald Trump	And the money, it will be paid out faster -- far faster.	0
434	Donald Trump	You know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal.	0
435	Donald Trump	It wasn't something that they were committed to.	0
436	Donald Trump	Now it's a commitment.	0
437	Donald Trump	There's a big difference -- the 2 percent number.	0
438	Donald Trump	And that's why so many people weren't reaching it or hitting it.	0
439	Donald Trump	It was just sort of like this amorphous number out there.	0
440	Donald Trump	Now it's a commitment, a real commitment.	0
441	Donald Trump	I think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps.	0
442	Donald Trump	And I think we're going to have a good meeting.	0
443	Donald Trump	Regardless of that, I think we're going to have a good meeting.	0
444	Donald Trump	But this was a fantastic two days.	0
445	Donald Trump	This was a really fantastic -- it all came together at the end.	0
446	Donald Trump	And, yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately -- you can ask anybody at that meeting -- they're really liking what happened over the last two days.	0
447	Donald Trump	There's a great, great spirit leaving that room.	0
448	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.	0
449	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0

451	Jonathan Beale	Yeah.	0
452	Jonathan Beale	Jonathan Beale from BBC.	0
453	Jonathan Beale	I just wonder -- you think you're going to get along with President Putin at that meeting.	0
454	Jonathan Beale	Could you just tell us, why do you think that?	0
455	Jonathan Beale	Is there something you admire about him?	0
456	Jonathan Beale	And the second question, because you're just about to go to the UK, sir --	0
457	Donald Trump	Well, he's a competitor.	0
458	Donald Trump	He's been very nice to me the times I've met him.	0
459	Donald Trump	I've been nice to him.	0
460	Donald Trump	He's a competitor.	0
461	Donald Trump	You know, somebody was saying, "Is he an enemy?"	0
462	Donald Trump	No, he's not my enemy.	0
463	Donald Trump	Is he a friend?	0
464	Donald Trump	No, I don't know him well enough.	0
465	Donald Trump	But the couple of times that I've gotten to meet him, we got along very well.	0
466	Donald Trump	You saw that.	0
467	Donald Trump	I hope we get along well.	0
468	Donald Trump	I think we get along well.	0
469	Donald Trump	But ultimately, he's a competitor.	0
470	Donald Trump	He's representing Russia.	0
471	Donald Trump	I'm representing the United States.	0
472	Donald Trump	So in a sense, we're competitors.	0
473	Donald Trump	Not a question of friend or enemy.	0
474	Donald Trump	He's not my enemy.	0
475	Donald Trump	And hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend.	0
476	Donald Trump	It could happen.	0
477	Donald Trump	But I -- I just don't know him very well.	0
478	Donald Trump	I've met him a couple of times.	0
479	Donald Trump	And when I did meet him, most of you people were there.	0
480	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
481	Jonathan Beale	And Brexit -- sorry, sir, because you are going to the UK.	0
482	Jonathan Beale	What will be your message on Brexit?	0
483	Donald Trump	Well, Brexit is a -- you know, I've been reading a lot about Brexit over the last couple of days, and it seems to be turning a little bit differently where they're getting at least partially involved back with the European Union.	0
484	Donald Trump	I have no message.	0
485	Donald Trump	It's not for me to say.	0
486	Donald Trump	I own a lot of property there.	0
487	Donald Trump	I'm going to Scotland while I wait for the meeting.	0
488	Donald Trump	I have Turnberry in Scotland, which is a magical place -- one of my favorite places.	0
489	Donald Trump	I'm going there for two days while I wait for the Monday meeting.	0
490	Donald Trump	But it's not for me to say what they should be doing in the UK.	0
491	Donald Trump	I have great friendships.	0
492	Donald Trump	My mother was born in Scotland.	0
493	Donald Trump	I have great friendships over there.	0
494	Donald Trump	We have a wonderful ambassador -- Woody Johnson.	0
495	Donald Trump	And he's doing -- by the way, Woody is doing a great job.	0
496	Donald Trump	But it's not for me to say.	0
497	Donald Trump	I'd like to see him be able to work it so it could go quickly, whatever they work out.	0

502	Donald Trump	I see.	0

505	Donald Trump	I said, that might be going a little bit too far, right?	0
506	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
507	Donald Trump	Heartbreak.	0
508	Donald Trump	Is it heartbreaking?	0
509	Donald Trump	A lot of things are heartbreaking.	0
510	Donald Trump	No, I would say that Brexit is Brexit.	0
511	Donald Trump	It's not like -- I guess we'll use the term "hard Brexit."	0
512	Donald Trump	I assume that's what you mean.	0
513	Donald Trump	The people voted to break it up, so I would imagine that's what they'll do.	0
514	Donald Trump	But maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route.	0
515	Donald Trump	So I don't know if that's what they voted for.	0
516	Donald Trump	I just want the people to be happy.	0
517	Donald Trump	They're great people.	0
518	Donald Trump	And I do think I have -- I'm sure there will be protests, because there are always protests.	0
519	Donald Trump	But I think -- there were protests the night of the election, both ways.	0
520	Donald Trump	But in the end, we got 206 electoral -- 306 electoral votes.	0
521	Donald Trump	And one state said -- you know, it was interesting, one of the states we won, Wisconsin -- I didn't even realize this until fairly recently -- that was the one state Ronald Reagan didn't win when he ran the board his second time.	1
522	Donald Trump	He didn't win Wisconsin, and we won Wisconsin.	0
523	Donald Trump	So, you know, we had a great night.	0
524	Donald Trump	Protests?	0
525	Donald Trump	There might be protests.	0
526	Donald Trump	But I believe that the people in the UK -- Scotland, Ireland.	0
527	Donald Trump	As you know, I have property in Ireland; I have property all over.	0
528	Donald Trump	I think that those people, they like me a lot, and they agree with me on immigration.	0
529	Donald Trump	And I think that's why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.	0

536	Donald Trump	Well, I can't tell you what would be the ultimate.	0
537	Donald Trump	What would be the ultimate?	0

590	Question	Do you consider him as a security threat for Europe or to the U.S.?	0
591	Question	Thank you.	0
592	Donald Trump	Hey, I don't want him to be.	0
593	Donald Trump	And that's, I guess, why we have NATO, and that's why we have a United States that just had the largest military budget ever -- $700 billion approved; $716 billion next year.	0
594	Donald Trump	No, I hope that we'll be able to get along.	0
595	Donald Trump	I've said from day one, whether it's China or Russia -- you know, we're working on trade with China right now, and I don't say that's an easy situation, because that's been years of abuse of the United States by presidents, frankly, that allowed that to happen.	0
596	Donald Trump	So I've taken over a lot of bad hands, and I'm fixing each one of them and I'm fixing them well.	0

602	Donald Trump	Right now, we're in a pretty nasty trade battle, but I think ultimately that will work out.	0
603	Donald Trump	I really think we have a big advantage.	0
604	Donald Trump	You know, we've picked up $8 trillion in value, in worth, since I became President.	0
